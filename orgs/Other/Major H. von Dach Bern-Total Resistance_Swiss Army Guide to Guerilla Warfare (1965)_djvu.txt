Resistance to the Lust 


Let us assume the following: Switzerland has become a battle¬ 
field. Superior enemy forces have invaded the country. Here and 
there our troops have been overrun. However, many have succeeded 
in evading the enemy. They are still in possession of their weapons 
and equipment. They want to fight, resist to the last. But how? 

Or: The enemy has occupied a city. The population is under 
his rule. What does the worker, the employee, the self-employed do 
in such a cose? What does the teacher, the newspaper editor, the 
doctor, the state employee do? What about housewives, railroad 
employees, postal employees, and policemen? 

What do the soldiers do? What do the civilians do? 

Will some throw away their weapons since they believe con¬ 
tinued resistance is futile? 

Will others wait for the future, placing their faith in God, or 
will they cooperate with the enemy? 

So many questions—but where are the answers? 

One thing is certain. The enemy will show no mercy. The enemy 
will snulT out one life, dozens, hundreds or thousands without any 
qualms if this would further his aims. The captured soldier will face 
deportation, forced labor or death. But so will the worker, the em¬ 
ployee, the self-employed, and the housewife. 

The enemy will not make any distinction between soldiers and 
civilians. Experiences of the recent past have proved that annihila¬ 
tion of the conquered may be expected sooner or later. Sometimes, 
this process is only delayed. 

The officer, the noncommissioned officer, the teacher, the editor— 
each individual who, at one time or another, has made any deroga¬ 
tory remarks about the ideology of the enemy, who, before the war, 
stood up for democracy and liberty and vocally opposed dictatorship 
and despotism—all these will lead the deportation and liquidation 
list. This we must understand! 

What then must be done when the enemy is in the country? 
What has to be done in view of the certainty that danger and death 
will threaten each citizen, male or female, regardless of whether he 
wants to play an active or passive role? 



We believe it is belter to resist until the last. We believe that 
every Swiss woman or man must resist. We believe that the enemy 
cannot be allowed to feel at ease for even one minute in the con¬ 
quered territory. We believe that we have to inflict damage upon 
him, fight him wherever and whenever we have the opportunity! By 
speaking this way we huve clearly and explicitly indicated the pur¬ 
pose of this book. 

In case of war, resistance will come primarily through the Army. 
It is our duty to make-sure with our might that the Army iB and 
remains ready for war. We want this point understood very clearly. 

However, we want to show our people a way to resist in case 
parts of the Army are dispersed, split up or encircled. This is in 
case prisoners succeed in escaping or portions of the civilian popula¬ 
tion fall under enemy rule. We want to demonstrate that in the worst 
situation resistance is not in vain, but that it is a primary duty. 

We feel this book will make this resistance effective, that it will 
prevent bloodshed and loss of life because of lack of necessary know¬ 
how und ability. 

Perhaps one might say that it is wrong and unwise to discuss 
these things publicly, to write about them and to inform a potential 
enemy of what we intend to do should he attack us. We do not be¬ 
lieve in this concept. On the contrary, we believe that, because of our 
openly demonstrated will to resist to the last, the enemy will have 
one more factor to consider when evaluating the ‘pros’ and ‘cons’ 
of a planned “Operation Switzerland.” 

We publish this book with this in mind and hope that it will 
find thousands of readers.

INTRODUCTION BY WENDELL W. FERTIG, 
COLONEL USA - RET. 


(Colonel Fertig organized and commanded the Philippine-American guerrilla 
forces on Mindanao after the fall of the Philippines. During three years of 
Japanese occupation he developed them into a highly trained and effective force 
of some .15,000. His efforts aid much to pave the way for the return of the 
American forces to Mindanao in 1945. After the war, Feriig served as Consultant 
for Guerrilla and Monetary Affairs to IJ.S. High Commissioner McNutt. In 1951, 
he was assigned to the Special Forces Division, Office of Psychological Warfare at 
the Pentagon where he played an important role in establishing the Special Forces 
Center at Fort Bragg, N.C. In 1951, he spent several months studying counter 
guerrilla operations against the Huks in the Philippines; then with the French 
in Indo-China and with General Templar’s forces in Malaya. Col. Fertig retired 
in 1950 but has continued as a consultant in guerrilla warfare and counterin¬ 
surgency for the government and has lectured on said subjects at the Air Univer¬ 
sity and the Air Force Academy. Recently Colonel Fertig joined Panther Publica¬ 
tion’s Advisory Board ns a consultant.) 


To comment on this book is difficult unless it is considered as a 
text book or Field Manual devoted to the specialized problems of 
Civilian Resistance and their solution. The illustrations are superb 
and the text explicit. It is a how-to-do-it manual in a held that has 
been long neglected; i.e. what courses of action are open to civilians 
who reside in an area occupied - by a foreign aggressor. In case of 
enemy occupation, it is generally assumed that the civilians will 
resist. How such resistance is to be implimented or sustained is left 
up to the individual who is usually at a complete loss as to what to 
do. With the publication of TOTAL RESISTANCE this is no 
longer the case as this book spells out the when, where and how of 
developing and organizing guerrilla bands, a civilian resistance move¬ 
ment and an underground. 

Specific comments seem to be in order as there is no sustained 
story to review. The first of these comments touches a place dear 
to my heart. Among all the famous resistance efforts tabulated the 
guerrilla warfare in the Philippines goes unmentioned. Yet this was 
a resistance that sprang from the people and was carried on for five 
months behind the Japanese lines before receiving recognition or 
help from the Allies. From this experience came the basis for the 
concept and policy of the U.S. Special Forces. 



A resistance that can be organized and sustained early in the 
occupation has the best chance of surviving. It must be organized 
before the enemy can institute the block control system in cities, and 
while some unrestricted movement is possible in the country areas. 
Further it must be remembered that the most successful guerrilla 
movements have always been based on areas that arc isolated by 
terrain, poor roads and bad weather. Operations within a city arc 
difficult. The Warsaw uprising was an exception and this was pos¬ 
sible because of ghetto conditions that will not be found in other 
cities. Even there, the real effectiveness of the uprising was destroyed 
when it was tricked into premature attacks on the Germans, while 
the Russians awaited the mutual destruction of both adversaries. 

Secrecy is imperative. It is almost impossible to maintain but 
often can be better achieved through the use of misleading rumors 
than through tight security. To provide the enemy with several 
stories, all of which require interpretation and decision, will often 
provide the time needed to carry out an operation. 

In my command in the Philippines, I found that the only way to 
break out of an ambush action was to provide indigenous personnel 
with limited ammunition. A guerrilla with an empty rifle will retreat 
readily, while one with an adequate supply of ammunition will stay 
too long and risk capture. 

Medicines arc frequently the best means of financing any type of 
resistance. The individual items are easily carried. As an example, 
thirty atabrine tablets would take a courier further than thirty thous¬ 
and Japanese occupation pesos, and with much less risk of discovery. 

In preparation for issuing currency of your own, the adequate 
supply of paper and ink are very important. The enemy will attempt 
to control the supplies of these items, thus negating any possibility 
of providing an alternate system of currency. 

One need that is most important and which is mentioned but not 
stressed, is the need of an organization within the Prisoner of War 
or Concentration Camps. The basic organization should be pro¬ 
vided before the surrender takes place. The lack of this planning 
was responsible for uncounted deaths in POW camps in the Philip¬ 
pines. Divide and rule by the enemy lead to the break down of all 
command authority and the prisoners were at the mercy of the Japa¬ 
nese guards. In Singapore, the Australian troops entered the POW 
camp with a table of organization and command. They were able 
to present a united front toward their captors and fared better than 
the American POW’s who did not have such an organization. 

These comments do not lessen the impact of this fine manual 
which is the first ever published that not only describes the practices 



of the Communists but offers methods for opposing their oppressive 
rule. It is interesting to note that the Swiss Noncommissioned 
Officers Association is able to point where the dangers lay and how 
they may be met. 

In all of this, it is well to repeat six basic principles which must 
be present if such a resistance is to succeed and eventual victory be 
achieved. These arc: 

1. A loyal people who will support the effort at 
great risk to themselves. 

2. Favorable terrain, and organization to fit 
particular terrain needs. A possible safe haven. 

3. A source of adequate finances. 

4. Good communications (radio, telephone, etc.) 

5. An adequate supply of food to support the units. 

6. Support from an outside power (most important). 

The final paragraphs of the book bear repeating here. “If two 
enemies fight each other to the last—and this is always the ease 
where an ideology is involved (religion is part of it) guerrilla war¬ 
fare and civilian resistance will inevitably break out in the final phase. 

“The military expert who undervalues or even disregards guerrilla 
warfare makes a mistake since he does not take into consideration 
the strength of heart. 

"The last, and admittedly, most cruel battle will be fought by 
civilians. It will be conducted under the fear of deportation, of 
execution, and concentration camps. 

“We must and will win this battle since each Swiss male and 
female in particular believe in the innermost part of their hearts— 
even if they are too shy and sober in everyday life to admit or even 
speak about it—in the old, and yet very up-to-date saying: 

Death rather than slavery!” 

Wendell W. Ferlig 
Colonel USA - Ret. 



Introduction 


The author is fully aware of the fact that he has touched upon 
a difficult and unpleasant subject. Nevertheless, in the age of total 
warfare where not only material but also ideological factors are at 
stake, it is imperative to discuss these problems. 

It may be assumed that in case of a war, large areas—if not 
all—of our territory will be temporarily lost to the enemy. The Army 
may be largely neutralized even though sizeable units should con¬ 
tinue to fight for an extended period in the Alpine regions. 

However, the majority of the soldiers as well as the masses of 
the civilian populace will survive the campaign. Now comes the 
question—should these survivors become loyal subjects of the new 
rulers, waiting for salvation and liberation from the outside, or 
should the fight be continued in a new manner with all available 
means? 

It may be assumed that with the well known love for freedom 
of the population on the one hand and the proven ruthlessness of the 
potential enemy on the other, clashes between the occupation forces 
and the conquered will sooner or later become inevitable. Thus it 
may not be entirely useless to write about the atmosphere, tactics 
and techniques of guerrilla warfare as far as these can be recon¬ 
structed from the experiences of past wars from the Spanish guerrillas 
fighting against Napoleon to the French Maquis of World War II.

Part 1 


Organization and Conduct of Guerrilla Warfare 

I. Purpose of Guerrilla Warfare 


A. General 

The purpose of guerrilla warfare is to continue resistance in 
those parts of the country occupied by the enemy, or to continue 
the fight after the defeat of the regular army. 

Guerrilla detachments cause fear and confusion behind enemy 
lines; force the enemy to initiate complicated security measures thus 
wasting his strength; and inflicts losses on both personnel and 
material. 

The entire occupied territory must be pushed into a state of 
constant unrest so that no invader may move about alone and un¬ 
armed. 

Service and occupation troops of the enemy will have to take 
on extra security measures in addition to their numerous other tasks. 

The final phase will be a general, open insurrection whose aim 
will be to force the enemy from the country. 

B. Specific targets: 

1. Transportation routes (roads and railroad lines) 

2. Communications net (telephone lines above and below 
ground, telephone and radio stations) 

3. Power net 

4. Vital industrial plants 

5. Repair shops and depots 

6. Headquarters 

7. Transportation convoys 

8. Couriers, messengers and liaison officers 

C. Characteristics of Guerrilla Warfare 

Opposing forces during conventional war are supplied by the 
factories, warehouses and supply depots; guerrilla units, however, 
live on the war. 

Every guerrilla warfare unit commander has an incomparably 
larger amount of independence and freedom of action than he would 
have on the same level of command during a conventional war.

II. Organization of Guerrilla Warfare 

1. Formation of Guerrilla Units 

Guerrilla units require a nucleus of experienced troops which 
will serve as instructors and leaders. The enemy tactics of “leaping 
over” the front by air mobile units or “over-running” the front by 
armored units will undoubtedly leave many Swiss army units intact. 
These, in turn, will provide us with a nucleus of trained, experienced 
fighters for guerrilla units. 





In our army, the majority of the participants in guerrilla war¬ 
fare will consist of scattered portions of the army or of auxiliary 
services. It is imperative to bring them together as well as to recruit 
needed specialists from the civilian population. 

Dispersed Batallion or Regimental staffs will rally stragglers as 
well as combat troops, local militia, auxiliary services, Civil Air 
Defense personnel, police, and civilian volunteers. 

Where no staff personnel are present, alert officers of NCO’s 
will assume command and create an organization. 

Higher heudquarters—in case such a headquarters still exists 
and maintains communications—can only issue “general directives” 
or “operational instructions.” 

Guerrilla warfare can never be waged near front lines—only 
on secondary fronts. 

Without the support of the civilian population, guerrilla warfare 
will fail in the long run. 

Guerrilla operations will not be initiated near the front lines 
since the enemy will always be stronger there and the civilian popula¬ 
tion will be less willing to support GW operations. In addition, 
enemy regular front line troops normally do not oppress the civilian 
population. Behind the front, the civilian population, aroused by 
the terror invoked by political and police organizations which follow 
the front line troops, will become willing to engage in and support 
guerrilla operations. 

The enemy will hardly commit his strongest fighting units for 
security and occupation duties or against initial guerrilla opera¬ 
tions. Rather, he will utilize second-rate troops which will partially 
compensate for your weaknesses. 

You must distinguish between: 

a. Mobile guerrilla units belonging to the army or composed 
of army elements; 

b. Local, stationary elements of the civilian resistance move¬ 
ment. 

The idea behind guerrilla warfare is to conduct local resistance 
operations in the entire occupied territory by the civilian resistance 
movement {especially sabotage and counter-propaganda). At the 
same time, it is necessary to create certain liberated areas held by 
mobile guerrilla units. However, these areas are not to be held 
rigidly. They will be changed continually in accordance with the 
foremost rule of guerrilla warfare which states that “no terrain is 
held permanently.” 

As a rule, liberated areas can only be held for several weeks 

3 



or months, until the enemy has concentrated sufficient troops to initi¬ 
ate large-scale counter-guerrilla operations. 

By means of continuous small-scale operations conducted by 
local elements of the civilian resistance movement, you will scatter

development of the mobile guerrilla units. 

If you are in a position to form relatively large guerrilla units 
of approximately battalion size with heavy weapons, the enemy will 
be unable to occupy firmly the majority of the country, but will 








have to be satisfied with controlling key installations and the most 
important points, primarily routes of transportation and communica¬ 
tion. 


Ruins in bombed-out cities will also provide good hide-outs. 
Devastation wrought by atomic weapons will provide excellent places

2. Strength of Guerrilla Units 

The main problem is to establish a well-balanced ratio of 
strength among guerrilla units. 

When only small guerrilla units are operating, the enemy is able 
to control occupied territory by me&gt;ans of small, numerous posts 
containing a squad or a platoon. He will also form a strong central 
reserve force and install an elaborate net of spies, agents and in¬ 
formers. His control net thus becomes relatively efficient; consequent¬ 
ly, the guerrilla unit has little freedom of movement. 

However, if you increase guerrilla units from company to 
battalion size with heavy weapons, the enemy will be forced to create 
strong garrisons. As a result, he will have to be satisfied with pro¬ 
tecting key installations and routes of communication. If he is forced, 
however, to withdraw all small posts in the intermediate areas and 
only form a few strong points with reinforced battalions, it will be 
difficult for him to maintain sufficient reserve forces. Also, agents 
and informers will be unable to find any support in these areas and 
can thus be more easily eliminated. The enemy control net becomes 
thin and your freedom of movement increases. 

Guerrilla units of regimental size and above are too cumbersome 
and easily succumb to the temptation to operate openly in a con¬ 
ventional manner. If they do so, they will easily be destroyed by the 
superior enemy. Consequently, battalion size units with some heavy 
infantry weapons (machine guns, mortars) are most appropriate. 

Battalion size units are strong enough to attack larger enemy 
posts successfully (company strong points), yet they are too weak 
to become tempted to forget the basic rules of guerrilla warfare 
which are their protection. 

From late fall to spring, when no bivouac can be established, 
unit size will be reduced by dismissing personnel. In summertime, 
these personnel will be recalled. The same course of action will be 
followed when food is in short supply.

3. Replacements for Guerrilla Headquarters 

In order to wage an effective guerrilla war, headquarter units 
will need a variety of trained personnel. If need be, these personnel 
can be recruited from the civilian population. 

Postal, telephone, and telegraph employees as well as railroad 
employees and power technicians can provide technical advice for 
sabotage operations. 

Radio technicians can organize communication nets between 
guerrilla units and the remainder of the army holding out in a rear 
area, the civilian resistance movemenL and friendly foreign countries 
(if our own army headquarters no longer exists). 

Engineer officers will serve as demolition specialists. 

Prominent politicians, newspaper editors, etc., can serve as 
liaison personnel between guerrilla units and the local populace, and 
the civilian resistance movement. 

Editors and other newspaper personnel will operate guerrilla 
controlled presses in cooperation with the civilian resistance move¬ 
ment. 

A list of the above mentioned technicians will be kept by the 
personnel section at headquarters. 


4. Organizational Phase 

The enemy will leave certain areas unoccupied due to their lack 
of importance. He will be unable to occupy some areas because of 
insufficient personnel. 

You have to'move into all of these areas. 

Assemble small groups of personnel at these places. Remain in¬ 
active until your group is well organized. 

You must not provoke the enemy into taking counter measures 
against you during your moment of greatest vulnerability, i.e., dur¬ 
ing phases of organization and initial activation. Never again, not 
even in the most critical situations when pursued or even encircled, 
will your unit be as vulnerable and as in danger of disintegrating as 
it is during this initial phase. 

Shortage of trained personnel or technicians can be compensated 
for by recruiting suitable personnel from among the civilian popula¬ 
tion. By the same means, you will later replace personnel losses. Every 
civilian who joins you is permanently removed from enemy terrorist 
actions—arrest of entire clans, deportation, execution of hostages, 
etc.

Organizational tasks: 


Chief of Future 
Guerrilla Unit 


Population 

Find out who is generally re¬ 
liable. Find out who is willing 
to help passively, i.e., supply 
food, provide intelligence in¬ 
formation, etc. Find out who 
is willing to help actively, i.e., 
laying mines, serving as guides, 
hiding and caring for the 
wounded and sick. Find out 
who is passively supporting the 
enemy, i.e., followers, profiteers. 
Determine who actively works 
with the enemy. 


Guerrilla Unit 

Organize combat units 
(squads, platoons). Procure 
ammunition. Procure food. Ob¬ 
tain equipment (clothes, shoes, 
rucksacks, etc.). Stockpile arms. 
Train personnel with captured 
weapons. Convert artillery per¬ 
sonnel into mortar personnel. 
Convert auxiliary personnel, 
police, civil air defense person¬ 
nel, members of supply and 
postal units into make-shift 
“infantry personnel.” 


Even with experienced soldiers it is still necessary to implement 
a short training period. This serves: a. to acquaint leaders with 
their new personnel; b. to allow personnel to become familiar with 
one another. Training also familiarizes personnel with the basic 
tactics and techniques of guerrilla warfare such as march, security, 
liaison, communications, reconnaissance, techniques of sabotage and 
demolition; with the use of captured weapons and ammunition 
such as hand grenades, mines, explosives, etc. 

This training will take up to one or two months, depending upon 
whether you are already being pursued or still organizing unmolested, 
or whether operations have to be conducted immediately. 

The longer the organization phase the greater the chances of 
success as there will be fewer losses during future engagements. This 
in turn will increase self-confidence. 

Reconnaissance of future targets and systematic observation of 
the enemy can be carried on concurrently with organization and train¬ 
ing. 

Members of engineer and demolition units as well as infantry 
personnel and combat patrol experts will be incorporated into your 
guerrilla unit. However, since they will only account for a small per¬ 
centage of your personnel it will be necessary to train other individ¬ 
uals in these fields. 


10 




Artillery personnel will be converted into mortar personnel. 

Members of light motorized units; tank crews, drivers; pilots, 
ground personnel; anti-aircraft personnel, air defense personnel; 
postal and supply personnel; police, local militia, auxiliary service 
personnel will be utilized as infantry. 

Civilian volunteers will be drawn from the following sources: 

a. Individuals under draft age—cadets, pathfinders, pre-military 
trainees, and rifle club members. 

b. Individuals who have completed their obligatory military 
service. 

c. Individuals formerly found unfit for military service or those 
discharged for medical reasons. 

d. Individuals exempted from service who worked for institu¬ 
tions essential to the war effort but which are now under enemy con¬ 
trol such as railroad and postal employees, etc. 

Recruit amateur radio operators for replacements for operators. 
If necessary, obtain them through the civilian resistance movement. 

Assign chaplains and civilian priests to the medical section. 
They are well suited as liasion personnel with the population, espe¬ 
cially in the country. They can maintain contact with wounded 
guerrillas whom you have left with the population to be cared for 
“undercover.” 

Use armorers, and perhaps, civilian mechanics as instructors on 
captured weapons. Since they will quickly learn the operation of 
foreign weapons due to their technical background, they can instruct 
other personnel in their operation. 


5. Leadership 

Select leaders carefully. Guerrilla personnel must respect and 
accept their leader. Once behind enemy lines, no military policeman, 
no military court, nor any state power will help the guerrilla leader 
maintain discipline and fighting spirit. Military rank will then only 
play a subordinate role. 

An individual who leads by “bluff” is not suitable. He may be 
able to maintain his position in a conventional unit for some time due 
to the chain of command and discipline, but never in a guerrilla unit. 

Only real “troop leaders” who know how to handle people can 
maintain their position. 

The leader must also possess some technical knowledge since 
during guerrilla warfare it is less important to make great “leader-

ship decisions” than to conduct efficiently some relatively simple 
operations with finesse. He should be well versed in small unit tactics 
as well as mine and demolition techniques. 


6. Equipment 

Since a considerable percentage of your people will consist of 
auxiliary service personnel, local militia, plant militia, police and 
civilian volunteers, you will lack many items of individual clothing, 
from shelter halves and suitable shoes to canteens and thermos 
bottles. 

Obtain some sort of “field uniform,” i.e., outer clothing, overalls, 
ski suits or jackets, windbreakers, etc. 

Items of personal equipment, such as knife, fork, and spoon, 
mess kit, small cooking stoves, flashlights, rucksacks, etc., can be 
procured; by stripping these items from each dead enemy, by solicit¬ 
ing said items from the population, from shops in larger towns by 
members of the civilian resistance movement. 

Procure tents from civilian sporting goods stores or from out- 
doorsmen with whom your men are acquainted. 

Guerrillas dressed in civilian clothes can collect these items, or 
have them brought to you by members of the resistance movement. 

Make preparations for winter as early as possible. These include 
the procurement of bla .kets, good shoes, and protective clothing such 
as overcoats, windbreakers, ski jackets, warm under garments. Trust¬ 
ed women can tailor make-shift snow suits made out of bed sheets. 

Procure two radios per detachment—one for use on a power net 
and one portable set with batteries for reception in lonely regions 
where no power net is available (mountains, forests). 

Build up the supply of batteries for your portable radios with 
help of the resistance movement. Secure and hide these early since 
the enemy will soon requisition all radios and accessories from the 
population. 

Have your “amateur radio operators” operate your radios. They 
are technically skilled and can perform repairs with limited means. 

With these radios you will be able to monitor enemy broadcasts 
as well as those from friendly foreign countries and your own exile 
government. 

By equipping each guerrilla detachment and each radio of the 
civilian resistance movement with ordinary radios, it will be possible 
for your own army headquarters in the safe area, and your exile 
government abroad to communicate with you. They can communi- 


13 



cate over long distances providing advice and technical guidance for 
guerrilla operations or indicating specific targets which you are to 
attack. Furthermore, your morale and ability to resist will increase 
since you will feel less lonely and lost. 


7. Supply of Weapons 

Usually it will be easier to obtain weapons than ammunition. 
Crew-served weapons—submachine guns, light machine guns, heavy 
machine guns, rocket launchers, mortars—will come from dispersed 
elements of the regular army. These elements will provide the nucleus 
of your battalion firepower. 

Auxiliary service personnel, local militia and police will, as a 
rule, be able to bring their individual weapons—pistols, carbines, 
submachine guns. 

Supplying civilian volunteers with weapons will pose the greatest 
problem. Below are several ways you may solve this problem: 

a. Collect weapons from poorly policed battlefields. Remove 
usable weapons from destroyed tanks, fortifications, and downed air¬ 
planes. 

b. Remove weapons from the dead enemy. 

c. In practically all Swiss families, you will find an older, but 
usable, weapon (rifle 11, carbine 35). 

d. Collect privately owned weapons of hunters and marksmen. 
The owners will donate their weapons willingly because they run the 
risk of execution if the enemy finds they have concealed them. 

e. Requisition weapons from civilian arms shops or police sta¬ 
tions which eventually would have to surrender their weapons to 
the enemy. 


8. Supply of Ammunition and Explosives 

a. Basic sources of supply: 

(1) Ammunition which dispersed army units have with them 

(2) Ammunition supplied from hidden caches established 
according to plan by the retreating army 

(3) Ammunition systematically stripped from each enemy 
casualty 

(4) Ammunition collected in raids on enemy transport and 
depots 


14 



(5) Ammunition collected from poorly policed battlefields— 
from destroyed tanks, field fortifications, downed planes, 
etc. 

(6) Explosives retrieved by removal of mines from partially 
cleared or uncleared mine fields 

b. Possible sources of supply: 

(1) Sporadic air drops from a rear stronghold 

(21 Systematic air drops from friendly foreign countries 

Collecting weapons and ammunition from private parties such 
as hunters, marksmen, police stations, civilian rifle clubs. Requisition 
explosives and detonators from civilian construction companies and 
quarries, farmers and lumber jacks. 

Requisition all air rifles und ammunition from farmers. Such 
weapons are especially suitable for “special operations,” such as 
attacking individuals without making noise. If possible, procure two 
to three air rifles and pistols per detachment. 

Construct a camouflaged ammunition cache. Humidity is the 
greatest enemy of ammunition; therefore the cache must be carefully 
constructed. Build a grate using boards and logs, so that the packages 
will not lie on the ground.

Improvised, concentrated charges can be used to destroy fixed 
objects (railroad tracks, power line poles, transformers, etc.). 



Antitank mines serve as excellent, improvised, concentrated 
charges. Weight of explosive contained is always three to four kilo¬ 
grams. 

Artillery projectiles, mortar rounds and aerial bombs can be 
used as improvised, concentrated charges to destroy hard targets. 

It is best to attach the projectile to a board with wire. For a 
primer, use a small charge which is always attached near the detona¬ 
tor of the projectile.

9. Organization of Maintenance Facilities 

Distinguish between repair shops in “'liberated areas" and repair 
shops in “occupied areas.” Install make-shift ordinance shops in 
civilian locksmith shops, blacksmith shops, and garages. 

Your maintenance personnel, disguised in civilian clothes, can 
perform repairs in these shops which cannot be done in the field. 


10. Organization of Food Supply 

Guerrilla units ordinarily live off the land as well as from 
material taken from the enemy. Occasionally they establish depots. 

In “liberated areas,” i.e., in those areas over which guerrilla 
units have temporary control, food supplies are requisitioned from 
farmers, mills, shops and perhaps warehouses. It is obvious in such 
situations that friction may very easily arise between the population 
and guerrilla units. In this case, the “liaison man” to the population 
(see replacements for guerrilla headquarters) has to act along with 
the detachment commander to reduce the possibility of alienating the 
populace. (See section on “Relationship with population.”) 

The question of food supply, a difficult one to solve, has con¬ 
siderable bearing upon the tactics of guerrilla units. 

As a result, detachments (approximately one company) live 
alone and battalions are only formed for larger operations. It is easier 
to feed scattered detachments of 80 to 100 men each off the land than 
it would be in the case of a 400-man battalion. 

If you have high,grade and non-perishable food supplies or have 
captured those, keep them for the difficult times in winter. High-grade 
food items arc canned milk, chocolate, ovomaltine, crackers, canned 
items containing lots of oil and fat, smoked meat, bacon and hard 
sausages. It is advisable to store these items in well hidden depots. 

Food supply suggestions: When supplied by the population, be 
cureful not to expose yourself any longer than necessary. In summer¬ 
time, send out personnel in advance to have the population prepare 
the food. Then have it picked up by a “pick-up team” and eat in 
the open os you are safer there than in a village. In wintertime, wait 
under cover and only come to the houses to eat in a warm place when 
the food is actually ready. Obviously, these strict security measures 
can be relaxed—especially in wintertime—when operating in a liber¬ 
ated area. 


19 



11. Organization of Medical Service and Procurement of 
Medical Supplies 

Do not establish an elaborate medical service. The operation of 
field hospitals will be impossible, since units are constantly moving 
in a liberated area and often move from one liberated area to another. 

Provide only first aid. Take wounded and sick personnel to reli¬ 
able persons among the population who will hide and care for them. 

Doctors and medics with medical supplies and equipment are 
indispensable for guerrilla units and must be recruited from among 
the civilian population. 

Medical Supplies. 

a. Sources: 

(1) Supplies still in possession of dispersed army units 

(2) Supplies taken from the enemy 

b. Procurement—with assistance of the civilian resistance move¬ 
ment—from: 

(1) Civilian doctors 

(2) Civilian pharmacies and drugstores 

(3) Civilian hospitals 

(41 Aid stations in large industrial plans 

(5) Private homes (systematically scrounge small quanti¬ 
ties) 

(6) Pharmaceutical industries (surreptitious delivery by 
civilian resistance movement) 

12. Relationship with the Population 

The population is your greatest friend. Without their sympathy 
and active support you will be unable to exist for extended periods 
of time. As a result, you cun ill afTord to alienate them by brutal be¬ 
havior or lack of discipline. Such provacation should never happen. 
The possibility exists that guerrilla units may become a greater evil 
than the occupation forces. 

If you have to requisition something, do not demand it with a 
submachine gun, but appeal to the common goal and patriotism. 

Do not forget that the laws of the conventional war hardly 
apply any more; each old man, each woman and each child can 
harm you greatly if they want to. For better or worse, you are prac¬ 
tically dependent upon the good will of the population. You also de¬ 
pend upon their steady, “I do not know, I have not heard nor seen 
anything,” replies to enemy interrogators, even when this altitude 
might mean their deportation and death. 


20 



Initially, the population will be intimidated and without courage. 
This will change, however, with a longer war and occupation. 

An awakened, aroused population can support you in many 
ways. 

Passive support: 

a. Observe the enemy systematically and continuously 

b. Establish an inconspicuous security net for guerrilla units 

c. Procure supplies 

d. Hide and care for wounded and sick 

e. Conceal material and ammunition 

f. Serve as guides for guerrilla units 

g. Identify collaborators 

Active support: 

a. Supply technicians for guerrilla units 

b. Replace wounded and killed personnel 

c. Lay mines 

d. Sabotage wire communications 

Even if the population should act only half-heartedly in your 
behalf, you will always find some people willing to help you as ob¬ 
servers, scouts, and messengers. 

As chief of the guerrilla detachment, you must be extremely 
cautious in your contact with elements of the civilian resistance move¬ 
ment, even in liberated areas. Don’t forget that you have to change 
positions rapidly. Members of the resistance movement, however, are 
locally restricted and have to continue operations according to your 
directives. Consequently, you must not expose their “cover” for the 
sake of temporary advantages, or else they will be captured and 
liquidated by the enemy after your departure. 


III. Tactics of Guerrilla Units 

1. Your First Guerrilla Operations 

For your first objectives, select simple targets which you can 
master without any major difficulties such as demolition of high 
tension power poles, or laying mines on throughfares. 

Only after certain esprit de corps has been established in your 
unit and after the self-confidence of your people has risen because 
of a few successful operations, are you in a position to undertake 
larger operations—operations against railroad stations, bridges; 
ambushing marching columns, etc. 


21 



You will quite necessarily suffer losses and setbacks. However, 
your unit will have become sufficiently stable in the meantime to be 
able to withstand reverses without falling apart. 

As a leader you must get used to the fact that during guerrilla 
warfare many more, and sometimes entirely different, psychological 
factors have to be taken into consideration than in the regular army. 
Here you were always suported—perhaps without your realizing it— 
by the ever-present power of the state (laws, courts, police) to main¬ 
tain discipline. 


Schematic acceleration of operations: 
Raids on individual soldiers 
Raids on small guard posts

Ambushes, raids, suprise attacks 

You thus interrupt or endanger 
communication between individual 
enemy detachments.

po^s 


Heavy weapons enable you to 
attack fixed strong points; first 
small ones, then larger ones. 

&lt;5 

Your attacks will force the occupa¬ 
tion troops to withdraw from all 
smaller strong points and outposts. 
Consequently, both no-man’s-land 
and the individual liberated areas 
grow larger. Periodically, the enemy 
will, however, recover and attempt 
to deal heavy blows against you 
which you must evade. 


22 



2. (Operational) Security of Guerrilla Units 

The security of guerrilla units will generally be carried out by 
the civilian resistance movement through: 

a. Espionage 

(1) Systematically sound out occupation personnel 

(2) Report carelessly made remarks 

13) Monitor radio and telephone conversations 

(4) Bribe officials of the occupation forces 

1.5) Blackmail officials of the occupation forces 

b. Observation 

(1) Constantly observe roads, railroads, railroad stations, 
and airports, in order to detect the assembly of airborne or helicopter 
units as well as the approach of motorized columns and railroad 
transports. 

(2) The civilian resistance movement can report results of 
reconnaissance missions by radio, messengers, or carrier pigeons. 
Either members of the resistance movement or, preferably, liaison 
personnel of the guerrilla units attached to the headquarters of the 
local resistance movement can serve as messengers. 



Civillon Resistance Movement providos 




3. General Behavior 

.a. Proceed with secrecy, care, and cunning—even with slyness. 

b. Only use force when you can mass superior forces. 

c. Avoid any fight which might jeopardize the existence of 
your unit. 

d. The most important thing for your safety is maintaining 
secrecy. 

e. Ambushes and raids are your main fighting weapons. 

f. Never engage a strong enemy and never accept an open fight. 

g. When meeting a superior enemy you must divide into small 
groups, avoid the enemy and reassemble later at pre-dcsig- 
nated rally points. 

If you cannot avoid a fight with pursuing troops, do not engage 
in a decisive fight under any circumstances. Rather adopt delaying 
actions and break contact with the enemy as quickly as possible— 
certainly no later than nighttime which will conceal your movements. 

Once the occupation troops have gained relief by means of a 
successful attack and returned to their strong points, hurrass them 
again. Guerrilla units should reappear from hiding once the enemy 
columns have disappeared. 

4. March 

After a successful large operation you must move to a new area 
of operations. Prior to movement, establish contact with reliable 
persons in the new area. Send out one or two NCO’s in advance to 
reconnoitre the area thoroughly. 

You as the commander will roughly outline the route to be 
taken on the map and then consider by what means you will change 
locations without being detected by the enemy. 

Avoid highways and villages on the march. 

No long preparations or preparatory orders should give notice 
of impending change. You must keep your decision to yourself until 
the time for movement has come. 

If you have to make extensive preparations (i.e., moving ammu¬ 
nition and food supplies or large-scale reconnaissance), try to de¬ 
vise a cover by circulating a rumor about a false plan which seems 
credible and does not arouse suspicion. 

In order to intercept individuals who might inform the enemy 
of your plans, send out severul patrols a few hours before your move 
in order to lay ambushes far ahead on streets and roads. They will 
apprehend all persons |&gt;assing by and detain them during the critical 
period. If necessary, cut telephone communications also. 


24 



Whenever you encounter unfamiliar terrain, obtain scouts 
familiar with the area. However, release them only when they cannot 
possibly compromise your operations. 

Nobody should be allowed to know where you come from or 
where you are going. Your next operational area must be kept secret 
from everyone. 

Deceive the population about your strength. Always create the 
impression of being stronger than you really are (i.e., the remark: 
“. . . we are only the advance guard of a larger unit which follows 
over there”). 

If possible, only travel during the night in order to minimize 
possibility of your position being compromised. 

Since you have to avoid roads, the method of travel will usually 
be by foot. Obviously, you will have to march a lot. However, do 
not require unnecessary forced marches. Keep your men fresh and 
conserve their strength so that they will be in shape for any operation 
or movement. 

If possible always march in a closed formation. When every¬ 
body is close together, quick decisions con be made and implemented 
better and faster. 

Provide front and rear security by sending three to four men 
several hundred meters ahead and to the rear of your formation. 

5. Reel 

Move at night and rest in the woods during the day. 

Select woods for shelter. When forced to camp out in the open, 
utilize high points which will provide good observation. 

Security elements placed too far forward only endanger you. 
While resting, security is best established by placing guards in the 



25 



immediate vicinity of the camp. Also, enlist civilians for this purpose 
as they can observe the enemy in an inconspicuous manner. 

Post air observers during daytime at your resting places. At 
night, you will place two-man ambushes on each likely avenue of 
approach. 

If you bivouac after nightfall, keep the detachment together and 
post severul two-mun guard posts at 50 or at the most 100 meters 
from the detachment. As visibility increases after dawn you must 
increase security. 

To preclude being surprised by air mobile units which are your 
greatest enemy, be sure to designate guards to scan the skies. 

Never use the same camp two nights in a row, unless you are in 
a “liberated area.” Never spend the night in the same place where 
you have rested during the day. 

Issue new alert instructions every day so that everyone will 
know what to do in case of a raid. At the same time designate a rally 
point for stragglers. 

Personnel detailed elsewhere (individuals or entire units} must 
be kept informed of the location of rally points where they can join 
you later or least find out where the detachment has moved to.

6. Relay Simple Messages by Primitive Means of Communi¬ 
cations 

a. From time to time you will have to enter certain villages in 
order to: 

(1) Replenish food supplies 

(2) Leave wounded and sick with reliable civilians 

(3} Use the civilian telephone or the postal system (see 
section on “Use of telephone and postal service.”) 


26 



b. Simple messages can be relayed to you by civilians (mostly 
members of the resistance movement) by: 

(1) Opening or closing of pre-designated windows or 
shutters 

(2) Hanging out clothes 

(3) Displaying or concealing carriages, etc. 

Smoke and light signals as well as waving of sheets are too 
obvious and too dangerous for the signaller. It is best to refrain from 
such signalling. 

With these primitive, yet inconspicuous means, only very simple 
messages can be relayed, such as: 

“Attention, danger! Enemy in village!” or 

“No danger! Village free of enemy!” 

Use the above mentioned signals in such a way that they can be 
recognized with binoculars from the edge of nearby woods. 


7. Construction of Road Blocks 

Felled or blasted trees are best suited fur road blocks. Do not 
drop to big a tree in hopes of causing the enemy more work. You 
only waste a lot of time and explosive. 

If you do not have the means of installing booby traps with 
your road blocks, at least simulate them. Below are some examples: 

Separate, half hidden wires leading from tree branches into 
the ground which simulate trip wires to hidden charges. 

Loose and only partially covered pieces of sod next to the road 
I enemy may assume that poorly concealed mines are placed here).

27 



In guerrilla warfare you must install road blocks on open roads, 
where the enemy must expose himself to fire while removing them. 
This, of course, is contrary to everything you have learned about 
the construction of roud blocks for a conventional war. However, 
you must learn to think differently for guerrilla warfare. 

With smaller trees you will need little explosives or will need 
little time to expose yourself to enemy patrols while cutting them. 

Booby traps on improvised road blocks are the most important 
thing and not trees as such. 

The enemy will not remove the trees by hand but will haul them 
away by vehicle. However, when booby traps are attached he will 
need an armored vehicle, either a lank or armored personnel 
carrier, in order to be able to clear the road immediately and without 
regard to any possible explosions, or he has to get specialists (Engi¬ 
neers) to search for the booby traps and disarm them. In any case 
this will cause a loss of time. 

If the enemy is so ruthless that personnel losses caused by mines 
are of no consequence and he commits everybody—even untrained 
personnel—to remove booby traps, the enemy will sulTer casualties 
and you will have achieved your goal. 

Sabotage on roads is less effective than sabotage on railroads 
since each road block may be easily bypassed by rerouting traffic.

With stake mines Advantage: Quickly emplaced. 

Disadvantage: Dangerous to own popula¬ 
tion since little tension re¬ 
quired to set it off. 

Uncontrolled mine -19 Advantage: No danger to the population 

as mine can be only deton¬ 
ated by heavy vehicles— 
trucks, tanks, etc. 

; Disadvantage: Much time required while 
laying. Placement lakes 
about 10 minutes per mine 
during which you may be 
surprised by enemy patrols. 

Uncontrolled mine d7 Disadvantage: Much time required as for 

mine 49; in uddition, it is 
dangerous to population— 
it can be set off by little 
pressure. 

9. Sabotage of Road Net 

Destroy, change or remove road signs. 

Place nails on road. Only effective when used in large quantities. 

The population should be used in this type operation. The enemy will 

be forced to embark on a systematic road clearing operation (they 


29 



may impress the locul populace to help them). At any rate, sabotage 
operations of this nuture will cause the enemy a great loss of time. 
Coordination of this type of sabotage with operations at the front is 
indispensable since such sabotage is only of value when the enemy 
has to use roads continually. 



Suholage of Vehicles 

How can you sabotage a motor vehicle in such a manner that 
the breakdown will not be detected immediately but will require 
complicated and time consuming repairs? 

a. Sugar in gas tank 
I). Water in gas tank 

c. Loosen oil drainage screw to cause loss of oil 

d. Loosen screw on oil filter 

e. Loosen oil pressure lead 

How can you mistreat a motor vehicle so that is is disabled quickly 
without revealing~lhat you committed sabotage? 

a. Fill battery with plain water (destroy battery) 

b. Grease partially or not at ull (wear-out bearings) 

c. Do not fill with sufficient oil (will burn out bearings) 

d. Too much tension on fan belt will cause rapid wear 

e. Drive with low pressure in tires 

f. Drive into a curve in high gear to cause excessive tire wear 

g. “Ride” the clutch to increase wear 

h. Do not refill radiator completely 

i. Increase gas consumption by continuously driving in low 


gear 



j. Wear out brake linings by constant use of brakes instead 
of using lower gear 

k. Wear out engine by constantly driving slowly in high gear 
or driving at High speeds in too low a gear 

How can you quickly set fire to a motor vehicle? 

a. Burning newspapers under hood 

b. Soak rags in gas or oil, set them on fire and throw under 
hood 



Metal spike impedes motor vehicle traffic 

Left: Metal spike (compare its size with match and match box) 

Right: Emplacement of spike 

Manufacture: Take a small piece of steel about 12 to 15 centimeters 
long and 5 to "8 millimeters in diameter. File both ends to sharp 
points. Cut both ends with hacksaw about 3 to 5 centimeters. The 
four ports (They ore only held together in the middle section for 
about 5 centimeters) ore now bent outward. Though the spike may 
fall to the ground in any position one point will always be up. The 
strength of the spike and the length of each point are sufficient to 
penetrate even the heaviest truck tires. 

Use: 

a. Spread on streets (especially at night) 

b. Lay immediately in front of tires of parked vehicles (conceal 
spike by pushing it under tire). 

10. Ambushing Individual Vehicles 

Fire upon the driver and the assistant driver with an air rifle. 
With this type of weapon the shot can be hardly heard. However, the 
force of projectile is great enough to wound them so that you can 
dispose of them right afterward with a bayonet. 

By minimizing noise you gain time and can remove material

from the truck less hurriedly. If deemed feasible, you have the truck 
driven to a concealed location (forest, etc.) by one of your drivers 
in order to examine the loot. Dead enemy personnel must be taken 
along and buried. 

A collection section always immediately follows the assault 
element. This section removes all usable items and quickly withdraws 
to pre-designated rally points, often before the fight is completely 
finished. Thus the withdrawal of this section is covered by the con¬ 
tinuing fire fight. 

11. Raiding Enemy ColumnB 

Normally the enemy will be paralyzed by your raid. Neverthe¬ 
less, you have to take into consideration that he may react by attack¬ 
ing you out of despair or due to an especially forceful leader. 

Consequently, you must have a safe route of withdrawal, either 
utilizing terrain features which make enemy pursuit difficult, or using 
mines. 

In our mountainous terrain, raids with light machine guns, 
machine guns, and mortars upon transport columns on roads, march¬ 
ing columns and trains promise to be successful, even from a great 
distance. 

As the commander, you must clarify the following points before 
the raid: 

a. Time of initiating fire 

(1) Upon your orders 

(2) Opening fire by one lead weapon (then all others com¬ 
mence firing) 

(3) Automatically, when the head of the column has reached 
a certain point in the terrain 

b. Stop the lead vehicle: 

(1) By felling a tree 

(2) Mines 

(3) By firing upon it 

c. Distribute your fire throughout the column: 

(1) Determine who fires on the front portion of column 

(2) Determine who fires on the center of column 

(3) Determine who fires on the end of column 

(When using mortars, have them commence firing only 
when the entire column has stopped.) 

d. Signal for discontinuing the fire fight: 

(1) Bugle calls 

(2) Flares

13) Withdrawal according to time (for instance, five min¬ 
utes after commencing fire) 

e. After discontinuing the fight, personnel will return singly, 
and using separate paths, to predesignated rally point. 

12. Surprise Attacks 

A. General 

a. Reconnaissance by commander of guerrilla detachment: 

11) Observation through binoculars 

(2) Evaluate photos, drawings of objective 

(3) Obtain information from workers employed at installa¬ 
tions in order to select the most critical targets, to ob¬ 
tain information needed to calculate demolition changes 
and to determine the most desirable firing positions. 

b. Briefing detachment commanders in the area concerned 

(possibilities): 

(1) Have them observe the installation from a distance 
through binoculars, 

31 



(2) Brief them with photos or sketches, 

(3) Stroll by close to the installation posing as a harmless 
“civilian going for a walk” (bicyclists or motor vehicle 
drivers repairing something, farm laborers mowing, 
digging, etc.). 

c. Operational plan 

(1) The plan of the detachments must be as simple as 
possible. 

(2) They will usually operate in three parties: 

(a) Raiding party (eliminates the guards or at least 
keeps them pinned down) ; 

(bj Technical party (responsible for demolitions); 

(c) Reserve (isolates the scene of fighting, fires upon 
relief elements from well prepared, concealed posi¬ 
tions) . 

d. Implementation of Operation 

(1) Keep the plan secret from your own people until 
shortly before the operation. Only confide in those

people whose assistance is indispensable for the prep¬ 
arations (NCO’s). 

(2) Approach the objective quickly during the night, avoid¬ 
ing roads. 

(3) Occupy a well covered position near the objective 
where you will wait for the following night (attack). 
At this time, brief the entire detachment about the plan. 

(4) Favorable time to commence operation: Shortly after 
night sets in. Thus you can brief your personnel on 
the terrain during dusk. The operation will be con¬ 
ducted under the cover of darkness. The largest portion 
of the night will then be available to withdraw. 

8. Reconnaissance oj enemy security system 

a. Determine location of guard house. Report to any guard 
with an inaccurate pass or invent some other pretext so that 
you will be led to the guard house to clarify the matter. If 
you keep your eyes open, you will be able not only to find 
out the location of the guard house, but also to draw some 
conclusions as to numbers of guards and alertness of the 
enemy. 

b. Determine when the guard is changed. Observe changing of 
the guard during the day from a distance through binocu¬ 
lars; at night from close up (i.e., apartment opposite the 
installation). 

c. Determine weapon emplacements of guards. If they are so 
well camouflaged that you cannot make them out with 
binoculars, figure out where the enemy must have emplaced 
them by studying the features of the terrain surrounding 
the installation. 

C. Disposing of guards 

Study the habits of personnel on guard duty. Especially times of 
relief, guard posts and routes and pecularitics in their behavior. 

Unfavorable weather (biting cold, paralyzing heat, stinging 
heat, stinging rain) will facilitate your plans by reducing the general 
alertness of guard personnel. 

The simplest and surest way to dispose of guards noiselessly is 
to kill them with an ax. Do not use the sharp edge but the blunt end 
of the ax. Hit the guard obliquely with all your strength between the 
small of the back and loins or between the shoulder blades below the 
neck. Even in the dark you will be able to hit the place easily and 
without missing.

13. Attacking a Depot 



14. Surprise Attack Upon a Small Post 

Divide your unit into: 

a. Fighting element: 

(1) Fire support elements 

(2) Assault elements 

(3) Technical sections (i.e., wire cutting sections, obstacle 
demolition sections, mine clearing sections); 

b. Demolition section: 

Demolition, arson 

c. Loot collection section: 

(1) Light motor vehicles 

(2) Pack animals, horse drawn wagons 

(3) Civilians may be used temporarily to back pack items 


37 




Upon commencement of the attack you must interrupt all com¬ 
munications of the enemy with surrounding installations (neighbor¬ 
ing garrison) so that no help can be summoned. Cut all telephone 
wires leading out of the installation or cause a short circuit. You 
cannot disrupt radio communications. Therefore send out an assault 
element immediately to silence the radio station. Determination of 
its location is part of a careful reconnaissance.

Interruption of underground cables 

Underground cables consist of several wires which are insulated 
against each other and against dirt (cable). 

In some places, cables are inserted into iron pipes or concrete 
boxes to offer additional protection. 

The destruction of underground cables is complicated and dan¬ 
gerous since you have to dig a hole and because cables normally run 
alongside a busy street. 

In order to obtain results which arc to last for some time, do 
the following: 



a. Thorough procedure—dig up the cable which is usually 80 
centimeters underground. Remove the insulation and cut the 
cable in two. Replace the insulation, fill the hole and elimi¬ 
nate any traces of digging. 

b. Quick procedure—dig up the cable and cut it. Prior to filling 
hole lay ends of cable in such a manner (if needed, weigh 
down with rocks) so that they do not touch each other. 
Cover hole and camouflage traces of digging. On the average, 
such an interruption will last three to four days. 

Technically speaking, the best points of sabotage are where the 
cables cross a river. They are mostly mounted next to or underneath 
the bridge and can be easily cut. The disadvantage, however, is the 
fact that bridges are often guarded. 


30 


Interruption of overhead cables 

To disrupt overhead telephone net, cut or blast poles in such a 
manner that wires will break. Cut or blast trees so that they will 
damage wires when falling. Install one or two stake mines as well 
as a few anti-personnel mines which will render clearing and repair 
more difficult.

Telephone net 

Be sure to destroy those cables leading to important head¬ 
quarters (staff, etc). You can do this by shorting the circuits, pull¬ 
ing down wires, cutting wires, cutting and removing long pieces of 
wire. 

A simple method of damaging telephone wires is to attach a 
short piece of metal or rock on a strong, long rope and throw it 



0 Cable © Go* or water pipes 


41 




over the wires. The rope will wrap around the wires and you pull 
it to break them. It is best to do this in the center, between two poles, 
since the wire will break easiest there. 

Power net 

To damage high tension wires simply establish connection with 
the ground (ladder), if you do not have sufficient explosives to 
destroy the towers. 

Here you need a wire, at one end of which you attach a rock 
or piece of iron. The other end is to be inserted into moist ground, 
if possible. You then throw the weighted end over the line. Caution! 
Release wire immediately after throwing. 



To prevent any accidents you must be able to distinguish quickly 
between telephone and high tension wires. Remember arrangement 
of insulators which never changes from the following sketch and 
photos.

Damage electric wires 

a. From an overpass: 

Connect the protective railing with a track by means of a strong 
cable (thin wire cable) 

Attach a cable (wire cable 5-8 mm) at the protective railing. 

At the other end attach a piece of iron about 20 centimeters long 
to act as a weight. 

Throw the cable onto the electric wire from the railing. Let go 
of cable when it is thrown, to prevent electrocuting yourself. 

Since the railing and the walls of the overpass are grounded, the 
operation is relatively safe. 

Use only strong cables. Thin cables will melt at once causing 
only a slight voltage reduction. 

b. On an open stretch: 

Attach the cable, again weighted down by a piece of iron, to 
the track. 

Throw the cable over the wire. It is immaterial if the cable 
catches on the supporting wire or the electric wire proper. Both 
carry voltage. Immediately release the cable when throwing. 

Wires are installed high. Where you are unable to throw from 
a steep embankment or from a roof, the operation will be difficult. 
If at all possible, use an overpass. 



U 




c. Shoot the insulators down with a carbine: 

If possible, do this on an open stretch and far away from stations. 

When using this method, you must support the weapon (i.e., a 
wall, the shoulder of a man) in order to hit the target quickly and 
without wasting a lot of valuable ammunition. 

You have to distinguish between “support wire” and “electric 
wire.” The purpose is to shoot down the “support wire” by destroy¬ 
ing the supporting insulators and thus cause it to fall on the “support 
structure” (tower); you will cause a short circuit and the support 
wire will melt. 

Maintain a safe distance (30 to 50 meters) so as not to endanger 
yourself by the arc caused by the falling support wire. 

On dual tracks you must destroy both wires.

Sabotage o/ railroad bed (track system) 

Knock off screw heads. 

Screw heads can be knocked off relatively easily by using a 
sledge hammer. Heads will come off very easily especially when it 
is very cold. 

Result: Do not have great expectations. This will not derail 
trains. However, this will consume a great deal of the enemy engi¬ 
neers’ time and effort. 



Sabotage! Knack off screw heads with sledge ham 
mer. 


Blasting of tracks 

On un open stretch always destroy tracks at a curve. Always 
blast the outer rail. How big must the piece be that has to be blasted 
out of the track to cause the train to be derailed?

Travel direction of 
trains: normally

Destroy frocks on open stritcti, 

On an open stretch you must 
always blast tracks at a curvo 
for tno following two reasons: 

Bent tracks aro moro difficult 
to replace by tho enemy than 
straight onos of which he has 
an ample supply. 

Trains derail more easily In 
curves than on straight stretches. 
Always blast the outer rail. The 
centrifugal force of an approoch- 
Ing train will dorall It more 
easily at the blasting point and, 
at tho same time, will throw 
the debris onto tho neighboring 
tracks. 


Secondary blast. Only blast when you have 
&gt;V sufficient explosives. Tho outer tracks will 
be blocked anyhow by the detralled train. 

X Main blast. If you have limited amounts of 
oxplosives, only blast tho inner tracks. 


46 



If the engineer does not notice the gap and enters the curve 
with full speed, it is sufficient to blast a piece of a length of 30 
centimeters. 

If railroad personnel ore aware of the damaged track they can 
proceed across gaps of even 50 to 60 centimeters if they go slowly.

Sabotage of tracks by “greasing” 

Grease tracks on inclines with grease, oil, soft soap, etc.; you 
thus will block the stretch. 

Always grease both rails for a distance of at least 150 meters; 
otherwise the wheels of the engine will skid over the place by means 
of its own momentum or the engineer may sand the short stretch of 
greased track.

Train traps with explosive 

In order to derail transport trains you have to build “train 
traps” using hidden charges which are detonated the moment the 
engine passes the point where the charges are placed. 


47 















Creation of train traps by loosening rails 

a. Loosen tie mountings (key, screw, nails) on eight successive 

ties. 

b. Remove fish-plate. 

c. Apply leverage and move one rail toward the inside (crow 
bar, etc.) and jam the fish-plate in between. Result: The train will 
derail.

Destruction o/ Rolling Stock 

Most effective mtjans (to be used when you have sufficient time) 
takes about three minutes per wagon axle. 

Attach a charge of 1 kilogram tightly on the axle by means of 
two wires. 

Basic rule: Careful installation of charge requires a relatively 
long time; however, you will obtain greater results with least amount 
of explosive. 

When you are pressed for time, attach two demolition charges 
of 600 grams to a rope and hang it over the axle. To improvise, you 
may use two old cans of plastic or, if necessary, commercial type 
explosive. This requires approximately one half minute per axle. 
Keep the ropes as short as possible so that charges touch the 

axle. 

Basic rule: Hasty method with relative careless installation of 
charges takes little time but requires relative large amounts of ex¬ 
plosive which produce poor results.

Destruction of Electric Engines 

a. Shoot off roof insulators with carbine. 

b. Destroy instrument panel in engineer cabin with a sledge 
hammer. 

c. Destroy transformer oil containers in engine room (knock 
holes into the thin metal wall with a pick and set fire to oil 
that flows out).

ing through which coal is thrown). 

b. Destroy steering mechanism with sledge hammer. 

c. Fire into boiler with light machine gun or machine gun 
(steel-core bullets). 

Target: Center third of engine, about 1.5 meters in front 
of cabin. 


Sabotage of Railroad Rolling Stock 

a. Throw a handful of sand, abrassive powder, or metal shav¬ 
ings into each grease box. 

b. Covers on grease boxes can be easily opened, especially on 
freight cars. 

c. No immediate results will be seen. However, the bearings 
will soon wear out. 

Since no technical know-how is required and because of the 
simplicity of the operation, everybody can do it, i.e., railroad em¬ 
ployee when checking cars, or laborers loading or unloading cars.

Raiding a Railroad Station 

A railroad station consists of the following targets: 
a. Station building; bottom floor with oflice and small switch 
house, first floor with living quarters of station master (at 
larger stations the switch house is installed in a separate 
building next to or above the tracks).

d. Signals: Signals at entrance and exit. 

e. Communications center (official and commercial): Civilian 
telephone, railroad telephone, telegraph in office, i.e., main 
building. 

How to divide the guerrilla detachment: 

a. Raiding party—interrupts the telephone and telegraph com¬ 
munication, keeps railroad pcrsonel under control, and elimi¬ 
nates any guards. 

b. Demolition party—destroys technical installations. 

c. Reserve—isolates the objective, ambushes any enemy re¬ 
serve force which might arrive and covers withdrawal of 
raiding and demolition parties. 



Demolition: Place a 1 kilogram charge at lpot indicated by arrow. 

Order of Priority in Destruction 

a. If you have limited time: 

(!) Blast switches with 1 kilogram of explosive. 

(2) Blast switch tower with concentrated charge (hand 
grenade ‘13 with additional charge). 

b. If you have more time: 

(1) Also blast the main line pole as well as frog and center 
pieces of tracks. 

(2) If you have plenty of time: 

Also blast signals and cut wires to switches, signals and 
gates. 

c. Destruction of switches: 

Sabotage: Jam a wooden or metal wedge into the place indi¬ 
cated by arrow. The switch cannot be fully operated and the 


52 





train will derail. (Be careful! This method can only be used 
with the approval of the station personnel since personnel 
operating the switches would soon find out said switches 
were not functioning properly.) 


Destruction of switches 



d. Destruction of main Line Pole: 

The pole is usually located across from the station building. 
If pressed for time fire into the oil insulator with a carbine. 
If you have more time, blast the pole at location indicated 
by arrow. 



Destruction of moin pole (usually across from 
station building) 

If you have little time: fire into the oil insula¬ 
tor (I). 

If you have sufficient time: blast the pole at 
place (2) indicated by arrow.

Interdicting Railroad Lines 
Procedure 

a. Ascertain the most favorable points to be attacked. 

b. Find a concealed approach to railway for sabotage personnel. 
A simple break in the track will, on the average, result in inter¬ 
ruption of traffic: five to six hours for main lines (normally repaired 
at once by the enemy); six to eight hours for secondary lines (longer 
interruption since not repaired at once by enemy) ; twelve to thirteen 
hours by train derailments on main and secondary lines. 

Security of railways only becomes effective when a guard is 
posted every one hundred meters. 

54 











As a counter measure against railroad sabotage, the enemy will 
reduce speed limits for trains. Consequently, normally only the 
engine and the first three or four cars will be derailed; this reduces 
damage to the railway bed and to the rolling stock. 

But don’t be loo depressed. By virtue of the reduced speed limit 
you will still obtain the following results, even though results are not 
immediately visible: longer use of lines by increased travel time of 
trains; a reduction in line efficiency when adding up these individual 
delays. 

This “safety measure” causes the enemy other problems. 

Increase in travel time is especially a nuisance to the enemy 
cither during offensive operations or during critical phases of de¬ 
fensive operations. 

Therefore it is important for guerrilla units to maintain com¬ 
munications with their own army or allies, even though located 
hundreds or even thousands of kilometers from the front, in order 
to coordinate guerrilla with conventional operations. Monitoring radio 
frequencies may provide guide lines for planning such operations. 

Large scale offensives will allow each guerrilla unit to commence 
or increase offensive operations since the enemy can now be harrassed 
more safely than ever before, as he has less means of defending him¬ 
self against you.

It is important to create confusion in the rail system by causing 
abnormal train schedules; to delay traffic for increasingly long periods 
of time. 

You can do this by keeping the maintenance organization con¬ 
tinually busy; (alerting repair teams, making up repair trains, etc.); 
having something happen every day. Over the long run, it is more 
demoralizing and nerve wracking for the enemy to make smaller 
repairs without interruption than infrequent major ones.

It is wrong to interdict tracks on four different locations on the 
same day and during the same operation. Maintenance crews then 
have to be committed only once. They simply repair one point after 
another.

It is much more effective to interrupt one length of track on four

anew each time. The traffic How is impeded on four days. Confusion 
is thus greater, and the total period of interruption is almost twice 



material or troops, the enemy attempts to keep you from sabotaging 
railways. The civilians on the train serve os protective cover for the 
enemy. 

By pushing empty freight cars or oars with sand in front of the 
train (“protected" trains), the enemy will attempt to protect his 
valuable engines against train traps. 

In addition, by mounting anti-aircraft guns on trains (“pro¬ 
tected" and “armed" trains), the enemy is able to defend himself 
against guerrilla raiding parties. 

Fighting Railroad Patrols 

Guarding a railroad can be done by the enemy as follows: fly¬ 
ing helicopters at low altitude; use of trolleys; patrolling along rail¬ 
ways. 

Stopping Deportation Trains 

(Same procedure applied with motor vehicle transports.) Do 
not derail the train as you do not wish to injure persons being de¬ 
ported. Consequently, you have to block the railway but in such a 
manner as to prevent enemy foot patrols, personnel on trolleys or 
in helicopters from detecting anything unusual.

The block becomes effective just prior to the arrival of an ap¬ 
proaching train. 

The block will be noticed early enough by train personnel to 
stop the train in time and to prevent derailment or hitting the block. 

On the other hand, the train personnel does not have enough 
time to stop at a great distance and back out of the ambush area. 

It is best to use big trees which are blasted across the tracks and 
the overhead wire when the train approaches. 

If you do not have any explosive, drive one or two heavily 
loaded trucks across the tracks filled with sand, dirt, or rocks. 

Assign raiding parties to eliminate train guards. 

Organize the escape of the deportees before the operation. 
Determine how you will transport and treat the sick and injured; 
how you will handle injured personnel that cannot be moved. 

Determine routes of withdrawal; methods of securing with¬ 
drawal. 

For the operation proper you will organize your guerrilla de¬ 
tachment as follows: interdiction element will block the tracks with 
explosive, or loaded trucks; raiding party will eliminate train 
guards with light machine gun, machine gun, submachine gun, band 
grenade; special element will instruct the liberated deportees in 
proper behavior. They will administer first aid to enable injured to 
be transported, improvise stretchers, supply food. 


58 




Loot collection party collects weapons, ammunition, clothing 
and equipment from dead train guards, also perhaps one to two 
pack animals or a small motor vehicle. 

Those able and willing to fight will be incorporated into your 
guerrilla detachment. They will be armed and equipped with enemy 
material. 

Those unable to fight are hidden from the enemy by placing 
them with reliable inhabitants. 

The above mentioned method can only be used during mass 
deportations. The first transports will slip by. Unfortunately, a cer¬ 
tain “initial phase” for this type of operation is indispensable. By 
systematic observation, however, you will be able to determine the 
enemy’s methods of transport and those routes on which deporta¬ 
tions will take place. You may then initiate rescue operations.

On the holtom floor a large room with control and switch equip¬ 
ment; on the first floor the attendants’ living quarters for employees 
that have to attend constantly to the equipment. 

b. Fence:

e. Searchlights: 

A system of searchlights is installed on poles within the installa¬ 
tion which illuminates the entire installation so that work can be 
performed even at night. 

d. High tension poles: 

Power supply by means of high tension poles. The last pole 
usually is located in the immediate vicinity of the fence (closer than 
100 meters). 

c. Transformers and accessories: 

Includes transformers, cooling elements, switches and insula¬ 
tors; all of which are located in the open. Telephone to the attend¬ 
ant’s house. 


Assignment of guerrilla detachment 

1. Assault element breaches fence of installation by demolition 
charge or wire cutters; interrupts telephone communications to at¬ 
tendant’s house (also guard house); shoots out all searchlights in 
operation; eliminates guards; guards employees of the transformer 
station. 


61 



2. Demolition clement destroys the technical installations. 

3. Security element isolates the installation by preventing rein¬ 
forcements from arriving; covers the withdrawal of the raiding and 
demolition parties. 

If time is limited, destroy the transformers. They are the “nerve 
center” of the entire installation. Since there are relatively few 
transformers, this job will not take long. Transformers are protected 
by u metal wall about 10 millimeters thick. 

Destroy them with small arms fire, using armor piercing ammu¬ 
nition, anti-tunk rifles or rocket luunchers; or detonate about 4 
kilograms of explosive on the transformer. 

If you have more time, in addition to the transformers, destroy 
the cooling elements with small arms fire, using ball ammunition, 
anti-tunk rifles, or rocket launchers; or detonate 2 kilograms of ex¬ 
plosives which can be attached with rope, wire, or hooks halfway 
between bottom and top of cooling element. 

If you have sufficient time also destroy the insulators. Since you 
will find lots of these, this will take a considerable amount of time. 
These insulators are made of porcelain about 3 centimeters thick. 

Destroy them with small arms fire, blows from a sledge hammer 
or by detonating 20U grams of explosive placed between each insulator 
disc. 

If you have unlimited time also destroy the switch installation 
and high tension wires carrying the power of the entire installation 
by detonating three individual charges of 1 kilogram of explosive 
for each switch.

Righti 



Demolition of cross-country high tension poles 

Wrong: Do not blast a pole in flat country and next to a road as enemy 
is able to repair damages relatively easy. 

Right: Blast in a remote area and in difficult terrain (steep slope) so 
that the enemy will have great difficulties in transporting material and 
traveling to the site. 

Whenever possible, blast where the distance between individual poles is 
very great, such os rivers, ravines, etc. 



18. Suprise Attack on a Fuel Depot 

This applies to installations above ground. As a rule, fuel depots 
are located in the vicinity of railroad stations and are connected to 
them by means of rail sidings. 

On the ground floor of the attendants' house a refueling point 
for tank trucks is located behind a ramp. 

The 2nd floor contains attendants' quarters. The depot has sur¬ 
face tanks (capacity of up to several million litters—these are part 
of the installation) and underground tanks (accessible by a manhole) 
as well as a refueling installation (at the railroad track to empty 
rail tank cars). 

There is a telephone to attendants' quarters as well as the guard 
house. The fence around installation is of simple construction and 
by no means as strong as that protecting a transformer station.

forcements, and cover the withdrawal of the raiding and 
demolition elements. 

Priorities oj Destruction 

If pressed for time, only destroy the surface and underground 
tank installations. 

If you have sufficient time, also destroy the refueling system for 
tank trucks and rail cars. 

Destroy tank installations and tank cars in the open with anti¬ 
tank rifle or rocket launcher, or detonate at least 4 kilograms of 
explosive at the bottom of the tanks. 

If the tank does not explode, it will be necessary to set fire to 
the fuel. 

This may be done by using tracer ammunition, flares, hand 
grenades or using anti-tank guns or rocket launchers. 

Normally tanks are buried one to three meters underground. 
Detonate a charge'in the manhole, directly on the tank wall. If the 
tanks are full the explosion will rupture the tank walls since the 
liquid cannot be compressed. If the tank is not completely full, the 
empty space often contains fuel vapor-air mixture which may ex¬ 
plode. In any case the charge has to be placed on the outside of the 
tank. 



Manhole to underground fuel tank 

Open the S millimeter thick cover with key token from the captured depot 
attendant. Destroy by detonating 400 gram charge placed upon tho key hole.

19. Raid Against an Airfield 


Assignment of Guerrilla Detachment 

a. Assault element will: 

(1) Interrupt telephone communications; 

(2) Eliminate guards; 

(3) Kill flight and ground personnel in billets; 

(4) Destroy AA and searchlight installations of the air¬ 
field defensive system. 

b. Demolition elements will: 

(1) Destroy planes as well as technical installations. 

c. Security elements will: 

(1) Isolate the airfield being attacked; 

(2) Fight off approaching reinforcements; 

(3) Cover withdrawal of raiding and demolition elements. 

Priorities of Destruction 

If pressed for time, only destroy planes on the ground. 

If you have sufficient time, also destroy radar and radio installa¬ 
tions. 

If you have unlimited time, also destroy fuel depots and repair 
shops. 

Methods of Destroying Equipment and Material on an Airfield 

a. Airplanes—detonate a charge of 1 kilogram on the fuselage 
directly behind the cockpjb 

b. Radar installations—detonate a charge of 3 kilograms on the 
rotation mechanism of the antenna; a 2 kilogram charge on 
the instrument panel. 

c. Repair shops—detonate charge of at least 5 kilograms in 
the center of the repair shop, or set fire by using gasoline, 
petroleum, oil and grease which you will probably find in 
the shop. 

d. Fuel depots—see “Destruction of fuel depots.” 

e. AA guns—throw a hand grenade 43 into gun barrel. 

f. Searchlights—fire into mirror; place a 1 kilogram charge 
at turning mechanism; destroy generator with concentrated 
charge of 2 to 3 kilograms.

B. Air intake of jet engine. Throw a hand 
grenade 43 or o demolition charge into the 
intake which will cause heavy damage to 
wings, engine, or fuselage. 

C. Landing goar or landing gear housing on 
top. Place demolition charge of 500 grams 
at nose wheel, as woll as at wheels under 
wings.

RUNWAY 







20. Destroying a Bridge 

Important bridges will be demolished by our retreating troops. 
Guerrilla detachments will be in position to destroy “auxiliary 
bridges” built by the enemy. These will normally be of wooden or 
metal construction. 

Wooden bridges: 

Place hasty charges—pole charges, bangalore torpedo—across 
the roadway. If there are extension beams, use normal explosives. 

If you have sufficient time, also destroy the abutments. 

Metal bridges: 

If pressed for lime, use hasty charges; only destroy the beams. 

If you have sufficient time, destroy according to plan; cut the 
bridge by simply cross sectioning it. 

Blasting: 

Both of the lower beams; one upper beam; one diagonal strut 
on the same side; road way supports. 

By not cutting one of the upper beams, you will cause the bridge 
to twist-to the side prior to falling. Removal of debris is thus made 
more difficult and the reuse of the main girders made impossible. 

Do not harbor any great hopes during these very simple bridge 
demolitions nor any expectations concerning destructive effects. You 
will only interrupt traffic for a short period of time. In most cases, 
the enemy, utilizing modern construction methods, will rebuild the 
bridge destroyed in a relatively short time. As a result it is not as 
important how you blow a bridge but when you do it. A technically 
primitive demolition job, executed shortly before decisive opera¬ 
tions, is far more important militarily speaking than an outstanding 
demolition job executed during a slack period when the enemy is 
not so dependent upon the use of the bridge.

21. Temporary Occupation of Towns by Guerrilla Units 

The occupation forces may institute the following measures: 
dismantling important industrial plants and shipping them out of the 
country along with the labor force; mass deportation of civilians 
that arc suspected by the occupation forces; large scale destruction of 
public and industrial installations which cannot be dismantled such 
as power stations, gas works, railroad installations, bridges, etc. 

The enemy will especially implement these measures when he 
is forced by events which are beyond our sphere of influence (defeats 
on the front) to withdraw from the territory he has occupied. If 
guerrilla units and the civilian resistance movement are able to pre¬ 
vent him from doing this, they will render the country invaluable 
services by preserving at least a portion of the industry and public 
installations for post-war reconstruction. 

In order to do this you must he able to take over towns quickly 
and efficiently. Do this as follows: 

Phase One: 

Effect coordination between civilian resistance movement and guer¬ 
rilla unit. The civilian resistance movement will aid the guerrilla 
unit as follows: 

a. Reconoiler enemy billets, staging areas, depots and strong 
points in the town. 

72 


b. Keconoiter favorable assembly areas (apartments, sewage 
systemJ for raiding parties. 

c. Find out the best means of infiltration into these assembly 
areas, i.e., through the sewage system, via back yards, gardens, and 
parks; smuggling in by vehicles, or moving during blackouts, and 
by taking advantage of curfew hours. 

d. Commanders of raiding parties will conduct a reconnaissance 
in civilian clothes on their targets; during this operation they will 
be guided by members of the civilian resistance movement familiar 
with the area. 

Phase Two: 

Bring up the guerrilla unit. The resistance movement will point 
out roads and provide security. 

Phase Three: 

Raiding parties infiltrate into the town and move into the assembly 
areas through sewage systems, apartments and shops near the pro¬ 
spective targets. 

Phase Four: 

The most important targets (see figure) will be attacked suddenly. 
The main body of the guerrilla unit still outside the town'will be 
brought up by improvised motor transport, if need be, and will 
eliminate any enemy resistance. 

Break down your unit as follows: 

Assign detachments to isolate the town by sealing off the main 
routes of communication at critical points, such as bridges, defiles, 
etc. 

Assign detachments to occupy weak targets or those not de¬ 
fended. 

Organize raiding parties to eliminate billets, guards, and strong 
points. 

Security elements should support the raiding parties encounter¬ 
ing heavy resistance or oppose enemy reserves. 

You have to immediately motorize your security elements. Con¬ 
sequently, motor pools will be included in the most important targets. 
Assign drivers to the security elements. 

T argets: 

Occupy bridges as this will guarantee free flow of traffic for 
us. At the same time, it will block the enemy’s lines of communication. 

Occupy radio stations as this allows us to broadcast announce¬ 
ments to our own population and communicate with friendly foreign 
nations. 


73 



Occupy administrative and government buildings when enemy 
no longer offers unified and coordinated defense. This will facilitate 
control of our population; secure archives and documents and assist 
in arresting important collaborators and high enemy officials. 

Occupation of prisons will prevent the political police from 
executing political prisoners. 

Occupy telephone switchboards and administrative buildings to 
prevent the enemy from using them. Telephone communication system 
can only be interrupted suddenly at a central point. 

Occupy railroad installations to prevent the enemy from retreat¬ 
ing with his heavy material. This also prevents the rapid arrival of 
outside reinforcements. Due to lack of personnel you may have to be 
content with blocking 'the main routes of communications. 



71 . 



IV. How ail Enemy with Modern Equipment 
Will Operate Against your Guerrilla Detachmnt 

In order to be successful in counter guerrilla warfare in the long 
run, he is forced to occupy all important points simultaneously at all 
times, and at the same time systematically clear territories infested 
with guerrilla units. 

In order to control roads he will utilize motorized, mechanized 
or armored raiding units. The intermediate area will be controlled 
by helicopters. 

A detailed and never ending reconnaissance is important. 

Considerable commitment of personnel (infantry) is thus in¬ 
evitable. This is one reason why highly mechanized armies, where 
the percentage of infantry personnel is very small, have such a great 
difficulty in suppressing guerrilla operations. 






Guonfcd location 


75 




Direct commitment of the air force is normally too costly in 
comparison to the results obtained (except helicopter or airborne 
operations). 

During local resistance, company strong points are placed 10 
km. apart. 

Long-range radio equipment as a standard item of issue is 
necessary for troops. Normally, this will result in a difference of one 
echelon (i.e., the platoon will need the radio equipment of the com¬ 
pany, the company that of the battalion, etc.). 

Supply requirements are small since only a few small encounters 
will lake place. Support elements will have to be escorted at all times. 

Billets will be installed in larger, interconnected buildings. They 
will be protected by barbed wire and machine gun and mortar em¬ 
placements as well as by searchlights. By means of such fortification, 
more personnel can be allocated to pursuit units. 

Road traffic will only be authorized during daytime. At road 
junctions or intersections all vehicles will be stopped, convoys will 
be formed and accompanied through areas infested by guerrillas. Two 
escort vehicles (light tanks, armored scout cars) will accompany 
approximately 25 vehicles. 

Organization and Operation oj Pursuit Units 

Pursuit units are composed of 20 to 25 men (platoon) and only 
carry light weapons with them, i.e., submachine gun, assault gun, 
light machine gun, and hand grenades. 

Each unit lias the mission to hunt a certain guerrilla detachment 
for days or, if necessary, for weeks. - 

To do thiB effectively, the unit must conceal all of its movements, 
live the same as a guerrilla detachment. 

By your own actions it will become inevitable that the presence 
of the guerrilla detachment will be given away. 

Enemy agents equipped with radios localize the area in which 
your detachment must operate. 

Observation helicopters keep in touch once your detachment has 
been discovered and direct the pursuit unit from the air to the area 
of operation. 

Airborne reserves will be brought up.

Mopping-up Operations by Larger Units 

A thin line of infantry will comb through the guerrilla infested 
area on foot and on a wide front. Sector for a company is normally 
3 kilometers. 

At a sufficient distance a motorized reserve force—reinforced 
company—will follow. 

If artillery and armor are available, they will be assigned to 
the reserve force. 

If the infantry encounters strong resistance the reserve force will 
be called in by radio. 

Since a counter-guerrilla operation of this type only forces the 
guerrillas to withdraw but does not cause their destruction, a block¬ 
ing force against which the enemy is driven, has to be established 
prior to commencement of the operation. Usually, the blocking force 
will be stationed along some impassable terrain feature such as a 
river or mountain range.

Good observation and fields of fire are the prerequisites for 
positioning a “net”: 

Approximate assignment of forces is as follows: 

“Net”: One fourth of the infantry personnel available 

Two thirds of heavy weapons available 
“Beaters”: Three fourths of available infantry personnel 
One third of heavy weapons available 


79 






Hints for a break-out when you are being hunted 

Do not attempt to break out at the beginning of a mopping-up 
operation since the enemy morale and strength is high. 

Later, the enemy will be more careless, more negligent and less 
attentive. Soldiers will tend to bypass more difficult and tiresome 
terrain features. 

Linear formations will break up since people prefer—especially 
at night—to follow paths and favorable terrain features out of lazi¬ 
ness. Consequently, nighttime will offer the best opportunities for 
escape. 

Occasionally pursuit elements will concentrate to eat and to' 
reorganize. During these periods, the enemy will only have a thin 
screen of security guards which will increase your chances of break¬ 
ing out. 

In order to pursue a guerrilla detachment of only 100 men, the 
enemy will soon need a force ten to twenty times larger—one to two 
battalions. 

After a successful break-out assemble at a pre-designated rally 
point and move as fast and far as possible from the area.

You may reduco the possibility of enemy 
search elements stepping on the 
camouflage cover, breaking into the 
hole and discovering your people, by 
digging holes halfway under bushes, 
hazel trees, tree trunkc, etc. 

If the enomy does not use dogs you 
have a good chance of remaining un¬ 
detected. Consequently, during fire 
fights, concentrate your fire on dogs 
and their handlers. They are among 
your greatest enemies. Once a hole nos 
been discovered, all other members of 
the group throw off their camouflage 
and engage in the fire fight, for the 
enemy will conduct a thorough search 
of the area.

Time required: At least 
10 days. 














Part II 


Organization and Operation of the 
Civilian Resistance Movement 


I. Organization 

1. Missions of the Civilian Resistance Movement 

a. Maintain belief in final victory. 

b. Inform the population concerning appropriate behavior to¬ 
ward the enemy. 

c. Collect and conceal weapons and ammunition for the moment 
when, together with the guerrilla units, an open uprising can be 
staged. This will usually coincide with the approaching collapse of 
the enemy, or approach of allied troops. 

d. Develop an intelligence service which will assist guerrilla 
units, and portions of the Army still holding out as well as allied 
foreign countries. 

e. Maintain a fist of all atrocities committed by each official of 
the oppressors for the “Day for Settling Accounts.” (Through posters, 
leaflets and rumors, you have to make sure that everybody, even the 
enemy, knows ubout this. This knowledge will keep many an official 
from committing himself). 

f. Publish a free newspaper (“underground paper”). 

g. Broadcast radio programs (“Freedom transmitter”). 

h. Establish an organization to hide persons, sought by the 
enemy police (State Security Service). 

i. Establish an escape and evasion net for crew members 
of downed airplanes of allied countries or for escaped prisoners. 
(Refer these people to our own guerrilla units.) 

j. Falsify ration cards for the supply of persons expelled from 
the community as so-called “state enemies” and sentenced by the 
enemy to a “slow death.” 


83 



k. Counterfeit money and identification papers for persons 
mentioned above as well as those that had to “disappear” because 
of the State Security Service. 

l. Fight against collaboration (cooperation with the enemy). 

m. Orgunize sabotage. Organize attempts against the lives of 
especially cruel officials of the enemy as well as prominent traitors. 

n. Organize fighting elements for the time of open uprising. 

Curve of Collaboration 

A very small percentage of the population will collaborate with 
the enemy. This percentage will increase sharply right after the 
implementation of terrorist measures; it will then remain constant 
and after a while will decrease.

Curve ef •* •• 



The population is prepared for collaboration with the resistance 
movement by the mistakes of the occupation power and its “Quisling 
government.” Some of these mistakes are: forced conscription of 
labor forces for abroad; excessive work quotas (“production 
quotas”) ; breach of promise, blackmail, arrests, hostages, torture, 
deportation, firing squads; forced requisitions, dismantling of plants; 
overbearing behavior. 









2 . Recruiting for the Resistance Movement 

In spite of all their good intentions, not all people are suitable 
for active participation in the resistance movement. 

You have to select curefully active resistance members from 
umong the masses available. 

The success or failure of the resistance movement depends upon 
this selection. 

People thut huve held public positions during peuce time should 
not be recruited for the resistance movement. It is likely that these 
individuals will be arrested and subjected to brain washing. They 
should have no knowledge of the resistance movement, so your organi¬ 
zation will not be compromised, nor lose members. 

Make sure that this “basic rule of recruitment” is well known, 
even to the enemy. Thus you cun protect these vuluuble and coura¬ 
geous people to some degree since once the enemy is aware of this 
policy, his interest in them will diminish. 

Examples of members unsuitable for the resistance movement 
are: prominent politicians both active or retired; leading economists, 
editors, professors, important administration officials. 

All these persons arc too well known to participate in the “under¬ 
ground movement.” They certainly will be shadowed, will be arrested 
sooner or later, or even executed. For them it is best to join guerrilla 
units. 

Anybody wishing to work with the resistance movement must 
be as inconspicuous as possible und remain silent in public. 

Prominent personalities are also exposed to one special type 
of danger. During the early phase of the occupation they may be 
forced publically to support the enemy. 


3. Joining a Guerrilla Detachment or Changing Over to 
the Resistance Movement 

Personal danger in the “fight of ideologies” is no longer meas¬ 
ured in terms of whether you belong to the resistance movement or 
not. If, by virtue of profession or descent, you belong to a walk of 
life looked upon unfavorably by the enemy, he will liquidate you 
sooner or later either by deportation or by execution. To remain a 
“non-participant” in the resistance movement is no longer useful 
since the system of arresting hostages or mass deportation will indis¬ 
criminately be applied to everyone, fighter or non-fighter. 



In the hour of distress nobody will help the “non-fighter.” As 
a member of the resistance movement you are protected by it. It can 
warn you when the enemy intends to arrest you and help you escape. 

All those who by nature of their descent, profession or ideology 
are considered potential enemies and thus risk deportation or execu¬ 
tive, had best immediately join a guerrilla detachment or the re¬ 
sistance movement. 

Contact and work with individuals of similar conviction. If one 
remains alone and isolated his morale will deteriorate. The isolated 
member of the resistance is subject to the same threat of fear and 
desperation that a soldier may feel when isolated from his unit dur¬ 
ing conventional warfare.

the enemy. Develops new rules of be¬ 
havior toward enemy.

Each member knows only the bare 
essentials about the organization; as 
a result, the entire organization 

Planned splitring-up into cannot be compromised by the 

very many sections. No apprehension of one or a small 

centralization. number ol individuals. Information 

extracted from captured resistance 
members will compromise only a 
small portion of the resistance move¬ 
ment, therefore the organization 
can rebuild. 






c. Organization of “Escape Section” (20 to 30 Persons) 

Take care of the displacement of escapees: (1) A few drivers 
from cross-country transportation firms; (2) A few RR dispatchers 
and conductors and engineers who will allow escapees to ride without 
a ticket and hide them from enemy security units on the trains, if 
necessary; (3) A number of reliable inhabitants maintain relay sta¬ 
tions, where escapees can be lodged and fed before, during and after 
transport. 

d. Finance section 

Funds will be procured in the following manner: 

(1) Counterfeit money printed in allied countries and smuggled 
in to us. 

(2) Counterfeit money printed in the occupied territory. 

(3) “Camouflaged” support funds with large companies. 

(4) Recruiting of bank and postal employees, who will go 
“underground” with the resistance movement at a favorable 
moment and with large sums. 

(5) Raids upon enemy finance offices. 

Utilization of money: 

This money will be used to fund espionage operations, bribe 
officials, provide for persons that have gone “underground” and sup¬ 
port the resistance press. 

It is desirable to establish a compensation fund. He who wants 
to or must go underground must be assured that his family will not 
have to suffer more than absolutely necessary. By means of monetary 
contributions and payments in kind these families must be supported 
by the resistance movement. The same kind of support should be 
available to families of deported, imprisoned and executed persons. 

e. Organization o) counterfeit group (8 to 10 specialists) 

Counterfeit identification papers and change those in use. (Pass¬ 
ports, ID cards, ration cards, counterfeit money, gasoline coupons, 
official stamps, tickets, etc.). 

This group is composed of the owner of a printing shop who 
makes his equipment and material available; a section to counterfeit 
rubber stamps; mimeograph section; and a liaison man to resistance 
movement.

II. Enemy Operations 

I. Basic Rules of Terror 

If you resist political indoctrination and the enemy realizes that 
he is failing in his attempts to “convert” you to his ideology, he will 
attempt to obtain obedience through fear. He will try to create this 
fear by terror. The enemy has developed terror techniques which 
have proved very effective. You therefore must be prepared. If you 
are acquainted with these techniques you can resist them more easily. 

These terror measures are: 

a. Surveillance, of telephone and letters through censorship; 

b. Establishment of an agent and informer net; 

c. Arbitrary arrests; 

d. No public trials except “show trials”; 

e. Arbitrary sentences; 

f. Lengthy prison sentences out of proportion to the offense. 

Surveillance of telephone and letters 

The chances of success of the enemy mail censorship and tele¬ 
phone surveillance are practically zero in a larger city such as Bern 
where 160,000 telephone conversations are made and 200,000 pieces 
of mail are posted daily. 

Long conversations are especially of nuisance to the enemy since 
he can only monitor a few conversations or he takes the risk of miss¬ 
ing something important by stopping too early. 

Harmless paraphrasing and simple code words during telephone 
conversations and in letters even further reduce the effectiveness of 
enemy censorship. 

Arbitrary arrests 

The enemy will arbitrarily arrest completely harmless people 
in order to spread the rumor that they have become victims of his 
surveillance net. He wants to create the impression that his net is 
closely knit and effective. Do not fall for this trick but make some 
estimate of its capabilities and limitations. 

Arbitrary sentences 

The enemy does not punish according to the law but according 
to political requirements. As a result seldom is the some sentence 
decreed for the same offense. Thus, you always have to expect the 
worst. You may be sent to a forced labor camp for an indeterminate 



period or even executed for the slightest offense, if you are unlucky 
enough to be apprehended at a politically unfavorable moment. Ex¬ 
pedience dictates enemy action. 

Brutal behavior during arrests and interrogations 

Night arrests increase the sense of terror. People can no longer 
sleep in peace. Brutal treatment during interrogations and in the 
prisons tends to surround the State Security Service and its institu¬ 
tions (interrogation cellars, prisons, etc.) with a cloak of horror. 

Relatively high sentences 

Me who only writes a slogan on a wall runs the risk of deporta¬ 
tion to a uranium mine just the same us the radio operator of a 
clandestine radio stution. He who only throws a handful of sand into 
the grease box of u railroad car runs the risk of being shot the same 
as the one who sets fire to a large garage or even destroys a trans¬ 
former station. 

Propagation of “horror,” however, is a two-edged sword. Used 
adroitly, it can serve your cause by mobilizing, through hate and 
desperation, those that have remained passive until now. Do not 
attempt to mobilize the “undecided” by “counterterror.” Be patient; 
the enemy will take such measures that with the passage of time they 
will come to you quite automatically. Individuals forced to join you 
under pressure are unreliable. If needed, these people can still be 
used in the regular army where they have u close relationship with 
others and are under permanent control. However, during the resis¬ 
tance fight, where everything depends upon the secrecy and stead¬ 
fastness of the individual, they are of no use, and even constitute 
a danger. 

2. Stale Security Service (Political Police Buch as the 
“Ochrana,” “Gestapo,” “Cheka,” “GPU,” “SB,” and 
“AVO.”) 

The first prerequisite to be able to fight the enemy without 
suffering undue loss is to know him. 

The State Security Service (political police) is a foreign and 
sinister thing to you. For this reason it will present a greater danger 
than the actual occupation troops who are individuals much like 
ourselves and whose reactions you can estimate and predict. 

Actually, the Slute Security Service is less a police organization 
than a terror organization. Their knowledge of police techniques is 


95 



slight and never equal those of a normal security police or a criminal 
investigation organization. 

The actions of the political police are thus rough and do not 
demonstrate any finesse. What they lack in technical ability they 
compensate for by increased brutality and cruelty. 

The political police do not have a tight organization like the 
military. It is rather a mixture, hard to define at that, between “Party- 
Military,” “Normal Police,” and “Criminal Investigation Police.” 

The real striking power in' any of these sectors is naturally 
small. The secrecy, however, increases the effects of terror. The State 
Security Service exists less on effective results than on a reputation 
of terror. 

Normally the enemy does not even know himself exactly where 
the urea of responsibility of the State Security Service begins and 
where it ends. His natural tendency to create a state within the state 
is thus greut and mostly successful. As a rule, he also tends to 
terrorize his own army und administrative officials. Consequently, 
there is in most cases no real cooperation between these offices but 
only a latent tension and rivalry which in turn reduces mutual effec¬ 
tiveness. 

Members of the State Security Service normally work in civilian 
clothes. They appear in uniform only on special occasions. 

The State Security Service is not bound by firm rules and laws. 
In contrast to the normal police it has no intention of acting in a 
preventive capacity by its mere presence or to find culprits, if neces¬ 
sary, but rather it operates on the principle that “to prevent is better 
than to heal.” This means: each person who might become a potential 
enemy is liquidated now as a preventive measure, in many cases even 
before he has committed himself against the occupying power. For 
this reason entire sections of the population or professional groups 
rather than just specific individuals are systematically eliminated. 

The constant distrust even of their own officials is not caused 
by the profession as such, but is part of the system. By involving 
many agencies even during small affairs, no official can deviate from 
the line. Each must attempt to surpass automatically his colleagues 
in “cruelty,” “faithfulness to the system,” and “hate toward the 
enemy.” As a result everyone is watching each other. 

3. The Struggle for the Youth 

A. General 

An occupation inuy last many years. The enemy and especially 



me quisling' government installed by him, to consolidate power, 
will attempt to subvert the minds of the youth. 

The enemy not only wants to exploit economically and militarily 
the occupied territory for his own war purposes, but also wants to 
incorporate it into his ideological sphere of power. As a consequence, 
you are not only to be conquered but also, if possible, to be con¬ 
verted. With this policy, he not only hopes to obtain labor forces but 
also eventually individuals who will support his ideology. 

The enemy will write off the older generation, at least partially, 
as being impossible to convert. He will rely on terror to keep them 
in check and eliminate them, if necessary, by deportation or execu¬ 
tion. 

He will, however, turn with increased vigor toward the youth 
which he will attempt to convert by a variety of means—from prom¬ 
ises to naked threats. 

The struggle for youth is roughly divided into two parts: 

(1) Suppressing the traditional youth organizations and re¬ 
placing them by a “State Youth Movement.” 

(2) Elimination or at least a great reduction of the influence of 
family, church, and school upon young people, and replac¬ 
ing it with the influence of the party and its youth organi¬ 
zations. 

li. Suppression, oj free youth organizations 

The enemy fears the forces of community alive in free youth 
movement. His demand upon your mind is complete. As a result 
he cannot tolerate any other youth organizations besides the “State 
Youth Movement” created by him. Any type of allegiance to the old 
organizations will not be tolerated. 

Specifically, the enemy will forbid the traditional youth organi¬ 
zations to do the following: 

(1) Wearing of uniforms or pieces of clothing resembling uni¬ 
forms; 

l 21 Displaying insignias, flags, and pennants; 

(3) Marching, hiking, camping, etc.; 

I-I) Participating in any kind of sports activity. 

In addition to these active measures of fighting the organiza¬ 
tions, strong pressure will be created simultaneously to join the newly 
created “State Youth Movement.” It will be announced, for instance, 
that in the future any applicant for any type of advanced or key 
position will be accepted only if he can prove thut he was a member 
of the “State Youth Movement.” 



Elimination of conventional influence upon youth 



Promote joining by 
adroitely coordinated 
rewards or punishment 
(bread and butter and 
whip). 



Work hand In hand. The 
party organs and its youth 
organizations together are 
to replace as much as 
possible the educational 
influence of the home. 


98 











C. Means used by the enemy to exploit the youth include the un¬ 
scrupulous, diabolic exploitation of: 

(1) the youthful desire for action and adventure; 

(2) the ability for enthusiasm (phony ideas); 

(3) the ability to become easily impressed with such things as 
flags, uniforms, music, and pictures; 

(4) the little developed ability to judge critically; 

(5) the fact that youth forgets easily and is resilient; 

(6) the “conflict between generations” (normal latent tension 
with older generation); 

(7) the “golden promises” of the future; 

(8) the veiled and indirect coercion which is only used as a 
last resort. 

The enemy thus attempts to make the aims of youth the same 
as his. 

First phase of subverting the youth 

First of all, the youth is to be enlisted and won over to the 
enemy’s side by subjects of interest to them: 

Exploiting the “motor fad” of youth (knowledge of motors, 
driver’s school for motorcycles or cars). 

Exploitation of the “hunger for beauty” of youth (films and 
trips and colorful meetings). 

Second phase 

Introduction of political lessons (political influence). For the 
time being, only a very few lessons will be introduced which will go 
almost unnoticed in the clever, interesting, and technical programs 
presented by the state. Gradually, the number of hours of political 
instruction increases until it becomes the main subject. 

In conjunction with the above, a slow, almost imperceptible 
change of emphasis from sports to a systematic pre-military train¬ 
ing occurs. 

Since occupation may well last many years, there is a great 
danger of politically poisoning the youth. The enemy places great 
emphasis on political matters even in wartime. 

4. Fighting the Church 

A. Enemy operations against the church 

The totalitarian enemy will always label the church as a poten¬ 
tial “enemy” and will fight it accordingly. He will proceed with the 
greatest of cunning and will implement the dechristianization of life 



in stages so as not to be too conspicuous. He will not destroy the 
church in one attempt but will undermine it slowly over a period of 
several years. If he proceeds too quickly, general resistance would 
result. 

Under the concept of “church” one must include the Catholic 
church, reformation church, and independent religious movements 
(i.e., Methodist church, Christian Science, Jehova’s Witnesses, etc.). 

Operations against (he church will take approximately the fol¬ 
lowing form: (1) slandering the church; (2) making the church an 
object of ridicule. 

In an effort to prevent creation of martyrs, if at all possible, he 
will attempt to portray church figures as common criminals. For 
instance, moruls charges will be brought against priests or they will 
be accused of misdemeanors such as embezzlement. 

B. Special measures 

The enemy will resort to chicanery of all sorts to suppress the 
church, such as the withdrawal of coal allotments or reduction of 
power supply. He will discontinue religious instructions in schools 
and will eliminate special religious instructions such os “chatechism 
lessons,” “confirmation lessons,” etc. Possibly he will replace it for 
instance by a state “youth initiation” or similar action. 

The enemy will suppress Catholic schools and institutions; dis¬ 
solve religious associations; remove Christian symbols (crosses, pic¬ 
tures, etc.) in public (for instance, schools, hospitals, etc.); prohibit 
religious magazines and books; limit and finally prohibit church 
services. Parents will be pressured to quit sending their children to 
church or religious instruction. After a while, such instruction will 
also be discontinued under the pretext that it is no longer necessary 
since it is attended only by a backward minority or not at all. 

Similar procedure will be used to reduce church attendance. 
Church goers may be threatened with being black listed. They may 
be considered unsuitable for certain offices and positions for being 
a “backward church goer.” 

In many cases a so-called “public peace” is negotiated with the 
church after the initial wave of persecution. This is especially the 
case when subordinate elements have exposed themselves too much 
by their anti-church attitudes and have caused great attention. The 
subsequent period of calm is to smooth over the waves of indigna¬ 
tion and pucify the aroused public. The church itself will, based on 
experience, strictly udhere to the agreements made so as not to bring 


100 



on new persecutions. I tirougn tms action ns nanas are ouen tiea 
for long periods of time. 

C. Attitudes of Church in the Fight against Church 

The fight against the church also has its positive aspects. It 
separates the former followers from the truly faithful. When the 
church mukes sacrifices it will gain a closer relationship to those 
portions of the population which, until now, have remained aloof 
from its efforts and aims. When the church is being persecuted it 
will be able to do real missionary work. Greatest difficulties and high¬ 
est chances of success are thus directly related. 

The church must concentrate upon fighting against intolerance 
and a personality cult. 

The church must emphasize the fact that each of God’s command¬ 
ments will be revenged sooner or later. 

It must cultivate the concept of “help thy neighbor” and desig¬ 
nate as such nil persecuted persons. 

It must call attention to the responsibilities of a Christian, such 
as resisting the misuse of power, disobeying edicts impinging on 
freedom to worship; and must remind the people that children not 
only belong to their parents but should be brought up by them. 

5. Propagation of Dissension Among the Population in 
Occupied Areas. 

In order to consolidate his power, the enemy will attempt to 
set one group or class against another. 

Examples: 

City dwellers-0 Foster distrust toward the country folk. In¬ 

stigate dissension between consumers and pro¬ 
ducers. Discredit the furm population. 

Farmers-Foster distrust toward city dwellers. Foster 

distrust toward the working class. Aggravate 
resentment toward large land owners. Insti¬ 
gate dissension between producers and con¬ 
sumers. 

Working class-Create antagonism toward farmers. Aggravate 

resentment against the middle class. Foster 
distrust against intellectuals and the church. 

Middle class-Q Foster distrust of the working class. 

Artisans-Cultivate resentment toward working class. 

Stir up distrust against commerce and in¬ 
dustry. 


101 



To divide and conquer is the enemy’s favorite tactic. 

By temporary concessions to one or the other section of the 
population or group, he will attempt to obtain their approval and 
loyal cooperation. 

Do not fall for this well planned scheme to increase internal 
dissension. The tune will soon change. The enemy will only favor 
you as long as he needs you. Once he has accomplished his goal, he 
will drop you without any qualms. A complete 180° reversal in his 
course of operations will not bother him. He has been used to such 
radical changes for decades. 

If you agree to join the game and are short-sighted enough to 
pursue small group and special- interests against your fellow citizens, 
you will only aid the enemy and exhaust yourself. Nothing could be 
of greater advantage to him. 

6. Tactics Usd by Enemy in Destroying Clubs and Associa¬ 
tions 

Clubs and associations disliked by the enemy will not be pro¬ 
hibited at once, but will be initially subjeoted to various types of 
harassment, etc. 

If he immediately prohibits such organizations, he takes the 
risk of having membership lists destroyed. Therefore, he will only 
be able to apprehend leaders and prominent officials whereas the 
mass of the members will be able to go underground. A reorganiza¬ 
tion of the smashed organization, taking place later and illegally, 
is thus facilitated since the enemy does not have the membership 
lists. 

He will thus proceed carefully by observing and registering for 
the time being. He will also avoid smashing local branches of organi¬ 
zations prematurely so as not to alarm the others. 

When the enemy has obtained the membership lists he will 
destroy and outlaw the organizations. The State Security Service will 
watch former members in order to stifle any attempt to reorganize 
the club or association. 

The enemy will never oppose all clubs at the same time. His 
power would be insufficient to do so. He will rather suppress them 
individually, and at different times. He will suppress organizations 
in the following sequence. 

1. Political parties —Social Democratic Party 

—Middle Class Parties 

2. Unions 


102 



3. Youth Organizations —Political 

—Church 

—Political and non-denomina- 
tional 

4. Church —Catholic church 

—Reformed church 
—Independent religious groups 

7. Enemy Liquidation of Certain Classes of the Population. 

The enemy will eliminate certain classes or section of the popu¬ 
lation that he dislikes. During these “special operations” he will 
gradually increase the severity of class repression. 

Normally this will take place as follows: 

First, he will dismiss only those in key positions. 

then 

He will prohibit them from working in certain professions. He 
will force these classes to make contributions. 

then 

The enemy will bar these individuals from all types of work. 
He will then withdraw food ration cards since these individuals are 
“non-workers.” 

They will be discriminated against by being prohibited from 
entering certain places. They may be forced ■ to wear identifying 
insignia. 

They will be prohibited from owning vehicles, radios, or tele¬ 
phones, and prohibited from purchasing books and magazines. 

• then 

They will be deported to forced labor camps and liquidated. 


III. Operations of the Resistance Movement 

1. Procedure of the Resistance Movement 
Phase 1: Period of Observation and Evaluation. 

Be patient, allow the population to recuperate. Time will work 
for you. 

Observe the enemy and study his peculiarities. 

Sort out the population as follows: 

a. Who can be considered for active collaboration? 

b. Who hesitates? 

c. AVho acts passively or is indiflerent? 

d. Who has joined the enemy’s ranks? 



Phase 'Z: Organization ot passive resistance. 

Form cells by bringing together several persons who know and 
respect each other well. 

Establish connection with other cells. 

Consolidate the various cells. As soon as they become too large 
(more than ten persons) divide them and form new ones. 

Group several cells under a leader. They will then form a circle. 
As soon as several such circles exist, and the underground organiza¬ 
tion has reached a certain degree of development, you will begin 
forming special sections. 

Phase 3—Commencement of resistance operations. 

Inform the population about appropriate behavior toward the 
enemy. 

Remove persecuted persons from the reach of the police by, 
warning, hiding, or assisting them escape. Organize a propaganda 
machine. Isolate agents and informers. Initiate acts of sabotage. 

Keep traitors and informers in check by counter terror. Make 
it as dangerous to work for the enemy as it is to work against him. 

Continue to maintain passive and active resistance, until the 
occupation power has been weakened by events beyond our command 
and guerrilla operations to the extent that open insurrection can be 
initiated. 


2. Concealment of Weapons and Ammunition from the 
Enemy 

In practically every Swiss household you will find weapons 
and ammunition. 

They must be removed from the reach of the enemy when the 
country is occupied. 

To supplement arms on hand, also collect small arms and 
ammunition which, during the fighting, have been left in your area 
either by our own or by enemy troops. 

Keep these weapons until guerrilla detachments or the resistance 
movement need them. Weapons must be cleverly concealed as their 
illegal possession may mean a death sentence. 

The best method of concealing munitions is by burying them. 
In order to protect the weapons from considerable damage due to 
humidity, proceed as follows: 

Insure that the weapon is completely dry before covering them 
with a heavy layer of grease (only use weapons grease). 


104 



Close off the muzzle by means of a stopper made of grease or 

wax. 

Wrap a rag soaked in oil around the bolt. 

Wrap the entire weapon in a large cloth. Tie the cloth with 
strings. 

Place the weapon into a wooden box. 

Cover the joints of the box with wax (such as candle wax). 

Put a piece of tar paper around the box. 

Bury the box at a dry place, if possible in a building (such as 
a cellar with gravel ground, barn with natural ground, sheltered 
places, etc.). 

Check, clean and grease the weapon about once every two to 
three months. 

Pack ammunition as follows: (loose rounds, packages, cases, 
individual hand grenades). 

Wrap the individual packages of ammunition in about ten 
layers of newspapers. Place the packages into a wooden box whose 
bottom is covered with about 5 centimeters of dry sawdust. Close 
and wrap the box similar to the weapons container. 

The sawdust will absorb any humidity that may enter the box. 
Ammunition is very sensitive to humidity; as a result, you must 
change newspaper and sawdust about once every two months and 
air the ammunition for a while.

3. Concealment of RadioH from the Enemy 

Hide your radio immediately since the enemy will soon con¬ 
fiscate all radio sets in order to interrupt the last connection through 
the “Iron Curtain” of the occupation. 

He will want to lower your morale by preventing information 
from the free world or from your government in exile from reaching 
you. 

4. Manufacture of Illegal Printed Mutter 

A. Manufacture by individuals 

In the manufacture of underground newspapers, leaflets, etc., 
you must distinguish between items produced by individuals and 
items produced in a print shop. 

Individuals can produce several hundred copies of leaflets by 
typewriter, or various types of stamps. 

Equipment used to produce such material is inconspicuous and 
can be easily hidden. 

There arc several advantages to this type of operation. The 
raw material—paper and ink'—are easy to obtain. There is no noise 
during the printing. 

By working alone, you are relatively secure. 

Circulation will be small but this disadvantage is compensated 
for by the utilization of many individuals. 

Arrest of single individuals will not compromise the entire 
operation. 

R. Small shop 

A small shop utilizing mimeograph and stencil machines can 
print several thousand copies of leaflets, etc. The machinery is rela¬ 
tively small and cun be hidden easily. It is easy to procure raw 
material—paper, stencils, colors. Such machines make little noise 
when operated. Such machines can be found in large numbers every¬ 
where and can often be utilized when not being used for their normal 
work. 

If, during a search of private homes, supplies or paper and re¬ 
production machines are found, the inhabitants will face imprison¬ 
ment or execution. If possible, use machines which are serving legal 
means known to everybody, for your secret enterprise. Conceal your 
paper supply inconspicuously with other “legal” paper supplies. 

C. Large operation 

With printing presses found in shops or publishing firms you 


10A 



can reproduce ten to 100,000 copies of the items you wish to dis¬ 
tribute. 

Advantages and disadvantages: 

A large circulation can be effected in a short period of time. 
Each type of publication, from the handbill to the poster, is possible. 
However, security problems increase as several people must be 
brought into the operation in order to operate the presses; the 
machines create considerable noise during operation. The quantity 
of paper, type and ink will be correspondingly larger and may be 
difficult to obtain. 

D. The following security measures should be observed: 

Burn the carbon paper used, do not simply throw it away; waste 
papers (bad copies) must be burned as are stencils, rough-drafts, 
and manuscripts that are no longer needed. Each time material is 
burned, stir ashes with a stick as the enemy can read the charred 
pages with the technical aides he has at his disposal. 

Also, melt type and disassemble hand compositions. Camouflage 
noise of a large press by running the engine of a vehicle in front of 
the building; operating an air hammer nearby; turning on several 
radios full blast. 

E. Design of Illegal Printed Matter: 

Several people will be involved in designing posters, writing 
script for radio broadcasts and articles for underground newspapers.

If you are using a well-known, talented personality whose style 
of drawing or verse is well known, he can only collaborate if he goes 
“underground.” Under certain circumstances, this individual may 
only supply ideas and rough copies; an unknown person will then 
do the master copy. Anybody who can be recognized by virtue of his 
style, will be immediately arrested. 

The ban against listening to foreign radio stations or the con¬ 
fiscation of radio sets as well as censorship of the press, will increase 
the need for objective news and in turn the need for and importance 
of leaflets and underground newspapers.

5. Propaganda 

A. Distribution of lea/lets 

Do not distribute leaflets to strangers on the street since an in¬ 
former may lx: among them. Throw leaflets into mail boxes in stair¬ 
wells. 'I’llis can be best done by people wearing postal uniforms. He 
who rereives a leaflet should not keep it but will pass it on to reli¬ 
able acquaintances. The radius of contact will thus be increased und 
the most modest means of the underground movement will have the 
greatest possible effect. 

II. Distribution of Unilergrountl Newspapers 

Distribute underground newspuper to persons whom you know 
well. They in turn will pass them on to acquaintances who will read 
them and pass them on. Insert u request at the end of each newspaper 
and leaflet that the contents be copied by typewriter and circulated. 

C. Section for painting slogans on walls—writing slogans on walls. 

Slogans written on walls are a good means to keep the masses 

aroused. Slogans must be as simple as possible. It is best to use catch 
phruses; single letters or symbolic signs such us the "V” for victory 
were used by the western resistance movements during World War II. 

Slogans are best smeared on sidewalks and wnlls with oil paint 
und large brushes. If ncccsary, chalk, held sideways so that a wide 
stroke can be effected, may be used. However, chalk is easily wushed 
off. Oil paint, on the other hand, sticks to the object and can be made 
illegible only by repuinting. 

Large numbers of sloguns, appearing night uTter night, will 
make the enemy nervous and raise the self-confidence of the popula¬ 
tion since such activities demonstrate the inefficiency of the occupa¬ 
tion forces und the power of the resistance movement. 

D. Destruction of enemy posters 

Official notifications or announcements of the occupation forces, 
us well as propaganda posters supporting the enemy ideology, must 
be opposed or you will slowly “drown” in the flood of propaganda. 

Speciul sections should be created to teur off, scrape off, paint 
over these posters or paste over them with resistance posters. 

If tin; enemy surveillance of streets is ineffectual, use the cheap 
but time-consuming method of partially scruping or pusting over 
these posters. However, if surveillance is effective and tight, be satis¬ 
fied with pasting across the ofliciul poster a relatively small ribbon 
of paper bearing the inscription “Nothing but lies.” This will require 
little time and does not create unv noise. 



Equipment list'd by sections: paint bucket, spiitulus to scrape 
o(T enemy posters, rubber soled or tennis shoes, (noiseless') aiul per¬ 
haps bicycles as they are fast and make no noise. 

Keep iri mind that a typewriter is often more important than u 
pistol, a reproduction machine is worth ns much ns a light machine 
f!un. The Stale Security Service fears underground newspapers anil 
leaflets almost more than weapons and explosives. 

6. Conditioning of Resistance Leaders or Members Engaged 
in Extremely Hazardous Tasks. 

Just like your comrades in the guerrilla detachments who pre¬ 
pare their operations down to the smallest detail and train on certain 
phases at their camp prior to the commencement of the operation, 
you ure required to train your most important members in behavior 
during house search by the State Security Service and behavior dur¬ 
ing interrogation. 

A. Trainirifi, on behavior during' house search. 

As instructors, utilize former police olliciuls who know the tech¬ 
niques of house search and members of the resistance movement who 
have experienced house searches by the State Security Service and 
are acquainted with its methods. 

These house searches, conducted as part of the training, must he 
carried out in the same manner us those of the State Security Service 
in order to obtain as much realism as possible. 

The purpose of such drill is to show your comrade mistakes he 
made in Ins behavior; to strengthen his nerves by conditioning him 
In nerve-wrecking situations; and to demonstrate mistakes made in 
hiding contraband. 

/i. Training jor behavior daring interrogations. 

Here again, use as instructors former police or law officials who 
are versed in the technique of interrogation. IVople who have pre¬ 
viously been interrogated by tile Stale Security Service may he able 
lo give valuable tips, and last hut not least, he a living example that 
“one can survive such interrogations.” 

7. “Going Underground". Selection and Use of llidc-oiils 

Chiefs and important members of the resistance movement must 
maintain several safehuuses in the same city or district in order to 
hold conferences, or to go underground temporarily or permanently, 
if necessary. Likely places for such hide-outs are seldom used apart- 



ments, warehouses, homes of friends, or vacation cottages. Sometimes 
it may be necessary to commute continually on railroads or subways 
for a period of time. 


8. Security of Safe Areas. 


Locations which you must visit frequently, such as hide-outs, 
homes of friends, etc., must be made secure by using simple signs. 
Design a system of signals to indicate whether a location is secure by 
predesignated placement of shutters, flower pots; arrangement of 
curtains; open or closed windows; or clothes hanging on clothes 
lines.

Hide-outs are known only to a

No one knows all hide-outs. 
Especially important resistance 
leaders must have an Individual 
hide-out which is unknown to 
anyone, even his family. 

Store food and water ar the hide-outs so that 
you can hide for several days without expos¬ 
ing yourself. 


no 









These signs must be able to be recognized from some distance 
so that in case of danger you have the possibility of passing incon¬ 
spicuously by the house. 

This rudimentary security system may be compromised if, for 
instance, the inhabitants are arrested unexpectedly by the State 
Security Service before they have time to post the normal warning 
sign. For this reason, an additional security refinement must be 
developed and be of such a nature that you can activate it even when 
you are being led off in handcuffs. 

For example, place a flower stand in the stairwell and “acci¬ 
dentally” knock it over when you are being dragged by, etc.

9. Security of Underground Conferences 

A. Selection oj meeting place: 

Meetings of resistance members must be prepared at least as 
carefully as u raid, for they constitute a “special type” of operation.

A suitable place, (or instance, might be in amongst row houses as 
searching and encirclement are made very difficult and time-consum¬ 
ing for the enemy. Consequently, you may gain sufficient time to 
escape. 

Individual buildings in the open can be easily surrounded and 
then raided. Avoid them. 

fl. Behavior o/ participant going and returning: 

From the moment you leave your home you must consider 
yourself in “combat with the State Security Service” and be more 
careful than a soldier on reconnaissance patrol. Your type of fight 
is more ennervating, takes longer and is more cruel than any fight 
on the front of a “conventional war.” 

Observe the street prior to leaving homo to see if your house 
is being watched. Be as inconspicuous as possible once on the street. 
Watch out for repealed appearances of the same person who might 
be an informer, or member of the State Security Service shadowing 
you. Faces are hard to remember; thus pay attention to clothing. 

When checking to determine if you are being followed, do not 
turn around in a conspicuous manner. Instead, casually glance to 
the rear while crossing the street, lighting a cigarette, unfolding a 
newspaper, entering or leaving a shop. 

Use the public transportation system (streetcar), but during 
rush hours; the fuller they are the less likely anyone will be able 
to follow you. 

C. Security lor meeting place: 

Distinguish betw.een outer “security ring” and “inner security” 
ring. The outer security ring consisting of observers will be some 
distance from the meeting place. The inner security ring will be in 
the meeting place itself. 

Members of the outer security ring will observe routes of access 
and warn of the apprqach of police either on foot or in vehicles. 
Police buildings and garages should be watched to ascertain if more 
vehicles than usual are leaving. Warnings will be passed on by 
civilian telephone using code words. 

Inner security of the meeting will consist of one guard on the 
ground floor with a pistol or submachine gun and one observer on 
one of the upper floors who will move from window to window. 

D. Preparations in case o/ enemy action: 

Before the meeting convenes you must determine if you are 
going to fight or run if discovered by the enemy. If you choose to 


113 



fight, designate who is to serve as rear guard and who is to escape 
and what material must be removed. Designate predetermined escape 
routes. 

If you choose to bluff your way through, develop a good cover 
story; determine who is to hide what and how.

10. Courier Service 

It is imperative to develop a communications net in order to 
transmit orders and directives quickly as well as warnings of im¬ 
pending police action. 

As means of communication you will use: couriers; the public 
telephone system; civilian postal system, and clandestine transmitters. 

You must distinguish between: 


114 







“Tactical couriers” used for the internal communication in a 
small area, and 

“Operational couriers” used for cross-country communication. 
They also may be used to maintain contact with the government in 
exile. 

Suitable couriers are: 


a.

c. 


In rural areas: 
Door-to-door 
salesmen 
Cattle dealers 
Veterinarians 


Persons who travel a lot 
without causing suspicion

Your couriers are continually exposed to the 
danger of being apprehended. As a rule, they 
should thus know neither the sender nor the 
receiver, for these are the chiefs of the organi¬ 
zation. For security m asures, insert "middle¬ 
men" who accept messages or deliver them 
for transmittal.

4. Inner security ring of radio

5. Prepared hide-out about 500 
meters from sender In order

Transmittal o/ messages by radio 

Only use radios. The only extensive use of radios should be in 
contacting higher headquarters of the resistance movement and our 
government in exile in allied countries or our own Army head¬ 
quarters (remainder of Army at rear stronghold) if the latter still 
exists. 

It is worthwhile to expend a great deal of effort in establishing 
radio security measures. Messages should be sent in code. The radio 
station should be camouflaged and guarded. During tactioal situa- 

117 



tions, within the resistance movement, do not use radios. For here 
you have to transnut many messages daily. As a result, radio security 
is made difficult and the effort expended for security is too great in 
relation to the value of the various messages. 

Do not forget that the monitoring of radio transmissions and 
the use of direction finders are easier for the enemy than the inter¬ 
ception of couriers who disappear among the hundreds of thousands 
of citizens. In order to place your radio communications under sur¬ 
veillance, he only needs a handful of clever, technically well trained 
and well equipped experts. To intercept couriers he needs an army 
of policemen. 


11. Use of Trains 

If possible use secondary lines. Always travel on local trains. 
Board and leave the train at secondary or suburban stations. Main 
railroad stations and large trains (express, international trains) are 
more likely to be subject to more thorough surveillance by the State 
Security Service. Checking passengers while the train is in motion 
is more likely to occur in large trains than on “slow trains.” 

Example: You want to travel from Bern to Luzern. Walk or use 
the bus to get to the station at Ostermundingen. There board the local 
train to Langnau. In Langnau transfer to the next “slow train” going 
in the direction of Luzern. However, leave the train at the small 
station in Littau, four kilometers before reaching Luzern, and then 
walk the rest of the way. 


12. Neutralizing Informers 

A. Aims of enemy 

By using informers, the enemy hopes to collect information on 
your activities; sow distrust; make contact among members of the 
resistance more difficult. 

Nobody can trust his neighbor anymore. As a result, the organi¬ 
zation of the resistance movement, especially in its initial stage, 
becomes very difficult. 

Techniques of using informers can be seen in the following 
diagram:

for instance during

and qualified individuals.

the population (masses): 
what is the attitude 
toward the “system” 
what are the reactions to 
the various measures 
taken by the occupation 
forces (dismantling, 
terror, etc.) 


B. Recruiting Informers 

The State Security Service will thoroughly investigate the past 
and present, of those people who seem to be likely prospects as in¬ 
formers. Above all it is essential to^collect material with which he 
may be able to blackmail the victims at the appropriate moment. In 
this respect not only political opinion but also one’s private life are of 
interest. 

The following are points which are of special interest to the State 
Security Service: 

Does he have debts? 

Does he have other financial difficulties? 

Does everything work well in his marriage or is there a possibil¬ 
ity of black mail? 

Does he have a girl friend? 

Did he commit a foolish act sometime in the past which is care¬ 
fully hidden from his present associates? 

Is he extraordinarily ambitious? 

Is he bitter, dissatisfied and on bad terms with society? 


120 







Finally, the following are recruited as informers 

1. Politically incriminated persons who are 
given the choice of either working for the State 
Security Service or being liquidated. 

2. Families of political opponents under arrest 
and imprisoned or in concentration camps. In this 
case both threats and temptation are used by prom¬ 
ising execution or torture in case of refusal or 
casing conditions of imprisonment or even release 
in cose of cooperation. 

3. People indulging in tax evasion, the black 
market, etc. 

4. Criminals who are promised release from 
prison or no sentence. 

5. Sexually abnormal persons 

6. Alcoholics 

7. Drug addicts 

8. Those lacking character who are willing 
to do anything for money. 

9. Idealists who have fallen for the “system” 
and are so blind ideologically that they are willing 
to perform even the dirtiest jobs. 

C. Defense Against Informers 

Passive measures used against informers: 

Discuss confidential subjects only in closed rooms never in a 
streetcar, railroad or restaurant. Speak only with persons whom you 
trust and whom you have known for years. 

When a third party arrives change the subject in an incon¬ 
spicuous manner. 

By maintaining a persistent silence in public the best source of 
information for informers will dry up. It is easier for them to pick 
up pieces of conversation in public than to infiltrate a group of 
people known to each other; in this group a personal atmosphere 
exists where an individual’s thinking and past are known to one 
another. 

Active measures to defend against informers: 

The meeting place for an informer is never located in the head¬ 
quarters of the State Security Service but always in some plain 





121 



restaurant where informers can come and go without being recog¬ 
nized or drawing attention. Insurance agencies, travel bureaus, etc., 
are very suitable as meeting places since in the constant stream of 
people, informers will not draw undue attention to themselves. 

Locate and observe these meeting places. 

Attempt to identify informers and thereby neutralize them. 

Insure that their identity is made known to the population 
through the use of wall posters, handbills and rumors. 

13. How to Meet the Danger of Being Overheard. 

Modern construction methods with its minimal wall thicknesses 
generally increases the chances of listening in. Prior to a conversa¬ 
tion, close doors and windows. 

Do not speak in those rooms of your home which adjoin a 
neighboring apartment or the stairwell. You thus prevent involuntary 
“overhearing” of your conversation but also a deliberate “listening” 
by your neighbor. 

If you have roomers or if you possess only one room turn on 
the radio. Its noise will drown out your conversation and prevents 
being overheard. 

If you fear that your home is bugged by the State Security 
Service, turn on the radio prior to secret discussions. Select a station 
approved by the enemy and turn it up to full volume. Any micro¬ 
phones will thus only pick up the noise of the radio. 

Apart from that, do not fear the danger of bugging too much. 
Microphones are seldom used for obvious reasons. 

14. Behavior During Interrogation 



If several officials of the State Security Service knock you down 
in the interrogation cellar, do not remain in their midst. This way 
they can all hit you at the same time. Attempt to reach a comer of 


122 



the room. Thus only two or three men can strike you at the same 
time. The rest would only hinder each other. 

Do not attempt to remain upright os long as possible. Play the 
role of the “dead” or “seriously injured.” Fall down on the floor 
and roll over onto your stomuch. Your sensitive organs ure thus 
in the center of a protective rib or bone cage. Kicking and clubbing 
will cause less damuge. In addition pull in your chin and attempt 
to protect your kidneys by pressing your elbows against your body. 

Always answer in a vague and indeterminate manner. The basic 
rule to follow during an interrogation is: “To say as little as possi¬ 
ble.” Keep in mind that the police cannot read your thoughts. They 
will blind you with gluring lights while the interrogation officials sit 
in the dark. 

Deny and refute everything, even when the accusations can be 
proved. At leust you will make propaganda this way. 

Avoid mentioning names. Since you are considered a “state 
enemy,” everyone whom you know will also be suspected a potential 
enemy. 

Hollering, threats and mistreatment ure among the methods used 
by the Stale Security Service. You must realize this. 

Do not be deceived by “friendship” of the State Security Serv¬ 
ice. This is only a technique used to throw you off your guard. The 
interrogating officials will show their true face soon enough. 

You can expect the following: solitary confinement; confine¬ 
ment in dark cell; und confinement in “small cells,” called “upright 
coffins,” which prevent you from sitting or lying down. 

You will be prevented from going to sleep by guards who will 
arouse you each time you begin to fall asleep. 

You can expect general mistreatment, such as healings, removal 
of teeth, extraction of finger and toe nails, being dabbed with a 
lighted cigarette, etc. 

They will attempt to demoralize you with horrible news, hunger, 
cold or thirst. 

15. Behavior in Forced Labor Camp (Concentration Camp) 

A. Organization 

By order of the camp administration, a “barracks senior” often 
has to be selected for each barracks; sometimes a “camp senior” has 
to be designated also. Where this is not the case you must do this 
on your own since by building an organization among the prisoners 
you can improve the living conditions considerably. 


123 



The net thus installed by the camp administration for technical 
reasons (contact with inmates) has to be used by you for your own 
purposes and even secretly improved. 

You must distinguish between: 

Camp net (comprises the entire camp) and 

Barracks net (comprises the various barracks) 

In camps with less control you are able to build both nets, 
whereas in camps run with strict discipline you can only institute 
the barracks net. 

In the barracks net the chief is the “barracks senior.” His aids 
are the confidants of the barracks inmates. 

In the camp net the chief is the “camp senior.” His aids are the 
barracks seniors. 

The barracks or camp seniors arc responsible for contact between 
the masses of inmates and the camp administration (accept orders; 
submit requests; i.e., obtain permission to write letters, receive 
mail, visits, permission to smoke, etc.; submission of protests and 
complaints pertaining to treatment, food supply, billets, heating, 
hygiene, etc.) 

Assign as many missions as possible in the secretly organized 
net. By virtue of the fact that one has an ofHcc (mission) and must 
help others, his own problems will recede into the background. The 
more people assigned a mission in a barracks, the greater the possi¬ 
bility of maintaining the will to resist for long periods. 

B. General 

Take care of new arrivals. They .are naturally more demoralized. 
Instruct new arrivals about the general camp conditions and appro¬ 
priate behavior by a specially selected individual. If they are left 
alone their will to resist threatens to collapse. Then the enemy has 
reached his goal. As old inmates you have to take preventive 
measures. 

You can maintain the will to resist and morale by a variety 
of methods: 

Build the above mentioned organizations among inmates, in 
order to strengthen the feeling of solidarity and to improve living 
conditions. 

Spread true news about the world situation so as to foster the 
belief in the victory of the good cause. Organize singing and dis¬ 
cussion groups. 

Establish “package groups” in which each member will put his 
package at the disposition of the group. Even the most lonely persons 

124 



will thus share in tobacco products and additional food items and 
perhaps items of clothing. 

Trusted individuals will inform the inmates about the general 
political and military situation (some information will always filter 
through) ; issue instructions on behavior for the immediate future; 
issue directives on what will be discussed the following day with 
the guards during work (political conversion). 

Together with the political inmates a certain number of common 
criminals will be imprisoned at the sumc time; they arc to disturb 
the solidarity of the camp. You have to spot them soon and subdue 
them. They are very often informers. 

C. Details concerning camp or barracks net 

Organization of medical care: 

In many cases, the sick or injured are not admitted to the sick 
bay or arc returned to work too soon because of maliciousness or lack 
of space. Without cure given by comrades, the will to live to instinct 
for self-preservation will be quickly snuffed out and they quickly die. 

Organize a barracks aid service. You will, of course, lack medi¬ 
cine, first aid material und instruments. But this is not so important. 
The whole thing is rather a psychological problem. If the sick or 
injured feels thul his society is taking care of him. he will muster 
inner strength. 

Possible ways of helpi.ig the sick when lacking first aid material 
include: 

In summertime, give him the coolest place; in wintertime the 
warmest spot in the barracks. 

Quench his thirst; if possible, give him additional food items 
which the strongest have saved. 

Give him something to smoke. 

Coni him oil with wet cloths or give him additional blankets 
obtained from those in better physical condition. 

Assign him the lightest duties if sick individuals have to work. 

Take care of him generally. 

In each burracks system is a former doctor, pharmacist, student 
of medicine, first aid man, or some other suitable individual who 
can assume the role of a “nurse.” 

Organization oj Ministry : 

Each will reach a point of low morale when the last hope for 
life seems to disappear completely und a person is no longer able 
to believe in the future. To cope with this problem, the prison corn-

For this purpose, use doctors, priests, lay priests, salvation army 
members, etc. 

You will not lack qualified personnel outlined above for they are 
always subjected to special hate campaigns by the regime and are 





D. Relationship to camp guards 

Guards will always consist of two types, sadists and the decent 
ones who only go along with everything because they are forced to 
do so but condemn any excessive acts; yet they must remain silent. 
You must take advantage of this situation. 

Tactics: Drive u moral wedge in between the two types of the 
cump guards. Method: Find out who is decent. Talk with the guards 
(primarily during work). 

It is hammered into the guards that the inmates are the scum 
of humunity. By exemplary fellowship you must demonstrate and 
prove to the guards that you arc very decent people. Once this has 
succeeded you have won the first round und, at the same time, you 
will have pricked the belief of the guards in the infallibility of the 
regime. 

Never talk to a group of guards. Groups are always more agres- 
sive und meaner thun individuals. In a group, the individual is first 
u “member of un organization” und then only a “human being.” As 
uii individual, however, he is primarily a “human being” and secon¬ 
darily a “member of the organization.” As a result, always approach 
individuals. 

E. Passive resistance 

Passive resistance und actions of protests are, of course, very 
difficult to implement. Nevertheless, even here there arc several 
possibilities. Below is an example: 

If un inmate bus been killer! during an interrogation, “shot while 
escaping” or hus buen oflicially executed, sing in the next few days 
“I had a comrade” often und demonstratively. The meaning of the 
song will even be understood by a guard speaking a foreign language. 


16. Passive Resistance 
General behavior 

There ure many types of pussive resistance that can be utilized 
by housewives, children und the unemployed. 

If members of the occupation troops or collaborators enter a 
streetcar, u bus or a restaurant, discontinue all, even the most harm¬ 
less, conversation und let cold silence take over. If you are talked 
to directly, answer coolly and as curtly as possible. Also pretend you 
huve a date or urgent business to take care of in order to cut short 
the conversation and leave. 


127 



nctci iciurn me greetings ol the enemy but disregard him on 
purpose. When he wants to hold open the door or wants to help you 
get in or out of a vehicle, do not accept. 

Do not take a place in the same train compartment as the enemy, 
but rather stand in the aisle. If necessary, change cars. 

If only a few pedestrians are on the street, leave the sidewalk 
and go to the opposite side when a member of the occupation forces 
approaches. You can even enter n stairwell of a house for a minute. 
This technique is, of course, only practical when not too many 
people are on the street and your behavior will he noticed. 

If the enemy is waiting at a train station, streetcar station, in 
front of a movie or at the theuter, step buck so that a large circle 
will form in midst of the waiting crowd; this will make him realize 
the moral isolation to which he is subjected. 

Women and daughters: When you are asked to dance by 
members of the occupation forces or by their collaborators, refuse 
under pretext of being tired, huving no desire to dance, or being ill. 

In all those places where you have collective electric meters— 
not your private meter—burn as many lamps us possible at all times 
(for instance, stairwell, and cellars). By your increasing the power 
consumption u shortage will occur thus causing bottlenecks in 
industry and transportation. Since you cannot let the lights burn at 
night because of the strict black-out without causing attraction, do 
this during duytime. This has the additional advantage that it will 
coincide with the peak hours of consumption by industry which is 
especially effective. 

Behavior during quarters requisitioning 

It is very unlikely that the enemy will billet individual military 
personnel with the population. For obvious reasons he will keep them 
together where they can be easily controlled and protected. 

If, however, contrary to all expectations, the enemy billets 
personnel with the population or you have to accept a collaborator, 
proceed as follows: 

a. If he only has one room in your home, disturb his sleep by 
playing the radio as loudly as possible. If the radio has been requisi¬ 
tioned, have the children make an infernal racket. 

Call him to the telephone at any odd hour of the night. The 
phone will then have been either hung up or he will have to listen 
to some derogatory remark. Mobilize all of your acquaintances for 
these calls. 

b. When he has his own place, ring his bell anytime during the 


128 



uu; ui j usn in me ocu ouuon and squeeze in a match so that 

it will stick in the bell and thus ring continuously. It is very un¬ 
pleasant to be awakened up out of deep sleep and have to run down¬ 
stairs from the fourth floor in order to remove the disturbance. 

Always throw pieces of paper containing threats and reproaches 
into his mailbox. 

Cull him at any time of the day or night. Criticize him on the 
telephone and uttempt to influence him politically. He will have to 
acce|&gt;t the calls whether he wants to or not since he never knows if 
it is a call from his office or headquarters. To hear night after night 
that one “will be picked up” and that “one will receive the bill for 
payment” will tear even the strongest nerves of a traitor. 

c. How to mukc his life more difficult in still other ways: 

A mailman should damage his mail on purpose (letters, news¬ 
papers get wet or wadded up and partially torn; let packages fall 
into the mud). 

Laundry |&gt;ersonnel should not wash his clothes clean or iron 
them nicely. Pour bleach into the wash water so that clothes will 
suffer unduly. If you don’t huve these means, leave his clothes in 
the washing machine three or four times as long as required. 

If you arc unfortunate enough to be a forced laborer in one 
of his laundries, you can harass the enemy most by excessive use 
of soap and soap powder. They are items always short in supply, 
thus rationed. Insufficient rinsing will soon lead to chemical damages. 
Ironing with a very hot iron will affect linen adversely. But watch 
out! Too much heat will brown the material and thus betray your 
intentions. Here, the same as any other place, the main problem is 
that one can “blunder” only to the extent that merchandise or a 
piece of work will just slip by in case of a check. 

Doctors, pharmacists, druggists, nurses, etc. 

The above will treat and supply medicine to people who have 
joined the underground. 

Always give the appearance of using more medicine and medical 
supplies than is really needed. Put aside the “surplus” and have it 
transported secretly to the guerrilla units via the resistance move¬ 
ment. 

Warehousemen (food warehouses, juel depots, etc.) 

Distribute goods located in the central depots. Prior to arrival 
of occupation troops, distribute food and fuel to the civilian popula¬ 
tion. Otherwise the enemy will seize the depots and use them for his 
troops and/or industry. 


129 



The individual housewife will be able to easily hide the small 
portion given her. 

Administration officials 

Perform each job in as complicated and time-consuming manner 
as possible. Increase the use of office materials. Misplace, hide or 
destroy personnel records. 

Frequently interrupt telephone conversations with members of 
the occupation force by hanging up on them. Only call back after 
live or ten minutes and excuse yourself profusely, explaining that 
you had been cut off. 

Word directives and orders ambiguously. Cause controversy 
over the competence of employees. 

Personnel officials 

Cause personnel lists to disappear. By doing this you will make 
it difficult for the enemy to make up lists of persons to be used for 
forced labor and deported, or to ascertain degrees of relationship 
during the arrest of clans and arrest of hostages. Execution or de¬ 
portation of family members, relatives or acquaintances in place of 
fugitive assailants or saboteurs). 

Town officials 

Town officials can steal blank identification cards. ID cards 
manufactured and issued by the enemy cannot be stolen by the 
thousands during an opportune moment. Otherwise you will run the 
risk that the occupation power will void the entire issue; thus your 
efforts and risks taken may have'been in vain. Police officials and 
town administrations must, therefore, put aside continuously small 
quantities (three to four pieces at one time) so that the loss will be 
unnoticed. By means of a liaison man they are then passed on to the 
resistance movement which, in turn, will pass them on to the counter¬ 
feit section for “processing.” 

Passports, personal ID cards of any type, identification papers, 
etc., of deceased persons may under no circumstances be returned to 
the issuing office even if this is required by regulation. If necessary, 
make up excuses. For instance, you did not see one or the deceased 
has never mentioned the existence of such a document. The enemy 
will be unable to check on these statements; the dead are silent for 
ever. 

Pass all these documents on to the resistance movement which 
can use them as a basis for new documents (change of names, dates, 
stamps, photos and description by the counterfeit section). 

130 



The need for counterfeit documents is enormous to provide 
“cover” for those who have gone “underground.” 

Uniformed Railroad Officials 

Give one of your uniforms to the resistance movement. It will 
allow them to conduct railroad sabotage more inconspicuously if 
disguised as railroad employees (easier approach of targets, better 
chances to reconnoitre). Label freight cars incorrectly. Direct freight 
cars to the wrong destinations. Load and unload cars slowly. “For¬ 
get” where cars are located. 

Uniformed postal, telegraph and telephone officials (for instance, 
mailmen). 

Give one of your uniforms to the resistance movement. Disguised 
as mailmen, they will be able to place underground newspapers, 
leaflets, etc, in the mailboxes of clients without causing suspicion. 

In addition, people disguised in uniform are better able to 
approach telephone switchboards, etc., to commit sabotage. 

Postal employees 

Postal employees can “lose” official mail, forward official mail 
to wrong addresses or intentionally delay or re-address official mail. 

Bank employee 

Bank employees can spread the rumor that a currency reform 
is imminent. The ensuing wave of purchases and accompanying 
disturbances of all types will be of great nuisance to the enemy. 

Telephone operator at switch boards 

Do not take calls from offices of the occupation troops. Make 
bad connections so that they can only be established with effort which 
will cause general annoyance. Disrupt connections in the middle of 
conversations. If necessary you can always make up some sort of 
excuse (“technical defect”). 

Police officials (Search personnel and uniformed policemen ) 
General: 

The enemy will attempt to take over in its entirety the existing 
local police organizations and use them for his purposes. Primarily, 
the local police will: regulute traffic the same as before; fight against 
crime (common criminals, not political “criminals”); continue the 
administration of penal installations containing criminals. 

Independent from the local police forces, the occupation power 

131 



will institute its own police apparatus for the political sector by organ¬ 
izing the State Security Service and an informer net. 

The enemy will establish prisons and concentration camps for 
political prisoners (“State enemy,” “Terrorists,” “Peoples’ Enemies,” 
“unteachable gTumblers,” as they are so beautifully described in 
his terminology). 

However, the enemy higher police headquarters will always use 
the local police for certain missions and support—depending upon his 
estimate of the degree of reliability of the local police force. This will 
happen especially in the criminalistic field since the State Security 
Service will possess only limited capabilities and is composed more of 
sadists than of criminologists. 

During this forced and repetitious cooperation of our former 
security and criminal investigation police force with those of the 
enemy a series of possibilities exist for sabotage. 

Possibilities for sabotage: 

a. For uniformed policemen 

As a member of a selected corps, knowing weapons and well 
trained physically, you should belong to a guerrilla detachment where 
you can render good services. If for special reasons you have not 
been able to join one of these detachments, act as follows: 

(1) Warn persons you are to arrest or of whose imminent arrest 
you have knowledge. 

(2) Give one of your uniforms to the resistance movement. 
Phony policemen, disguised in uniforms, can obtain en¬ 
trance to a prison, for instance, and get our arrested re¬ 
sistance fighters “legally.'*’ 

(3) During fire fights with saboteurs or fugitive political pris¬ 
oners, your weapon will jam or you will be unable to hit 
anyone. You can claim that you always have been a poor 
shot 

You also can quickly run out of ammunition. Hide the majority 
of ammunition you are carrying with you. 

At an opportune moment during fire fights, fire in the backs 
of the enemy police or military elements with whom you have to 
cooperate. Afterwards, the enemy will hardly find out by whose 
bullets his personnel were killed. With his well known ruthlessness, 
it is unlikely that his own people will be that valuable to him. 

During an engagement, fire upon your own parked vehicles'— 
squad, prison, and radio car9. For it is impossible to prove that it 
was your own bullets and not those of the enemy. 


132 



Sabotage, for instance, cordons by pretending not to pay atten¬ 
tion which will allow the break-out of encircled resistance fighters. 

Collect ammunition at any opportune moment so that you will 
have a large private cache when you join u guerrilla detachment. 

Possibilities: 

When on patrol open fire upon imagined saboteurs. But only 
fire two to three rounds to cause the weapon to become dirty; after¬ 
ward you will clean it at the police station while complaining. Retain 
five or six rounds as “expended” and hide them. Your patrol partner 
can vouch for the fire fight. In addition, shots were heard. 

During larger engagements in which you participate, expend 
almost no ammunition at all and retain it and hand grenades. Also 
ultempt to hide weapons. 

In cooperation with doctors have them issue false certificates 
of accidents so that injured resistance fighters can be legally ad¬ 
mitted to a hospital and treated disguised as “victims of traffic.” 

b. Drivers of police vehicles 

As driver of u police vehicle you will make your vehicle tem¬ 
porarily available to the resistance movement. A police car is an 
ideul vehicle to transport weapons, ammunition, explosives, leaflets, 
underground newspupers, rudios, etc. There is no better cover than 
a police vehicle. 

Persons in danger who cannot expose themselves in public any 
more cun be inconspicuously transported to safety and are relatively 
sufe by posing us prisoners. 

There will be muny times when you are alone in the vehicle 
und, consequently, will be ublc to use it to aid the resistance move¬ 
ment. Your cfTorts wdl be facilitated if your colleagues and superiors 
ignore your activities. 

If you have to drive your squad car with a single detachment 
into operation uguinst the underground, sabotage the operation by 
a variety of means. Pretend to have difficulty in starting the engine. 
Take u circuitous route to the objective or get lost. You may claim 
that the blackout confused you. Huvc a minor accident by running 
into a light pole or a telephone pole, or fire hydrant. The blackout 
can serve again as an excuse. 

c. Prison warden 

Allow political prisoners to escape whenever this can be done 
without attracting attention. 

if you notice thut people possessing false passes, ID cards 
und orders, want to pick up political prisoners, look the other way. 

At a later period, you may deem it necessary to join a guerrilla 

133 



aecacnment or to go completely "underground” with the resistance 
movement in order to avoid being arrested. Before leuving, allow the 
political prisoners to escape. 

Make a wax impression of the keys. But do not take the keys 
along otherwise the enemy will change the locks. The resistance move¬ 
ment will be grateful for the wax impressions. Take along as many 
weapons, ammunition and uniforms as you possibly can. 

d. Police radio operator 

Inform the resistance movement of everything of interest to 
them which you may have been able to monitor. 

If, at some given point, you have to go “underground,” attempt 
to take equipment along. If necessary, help stage a raid by members 
of the resistance movement who will be disguised as policemen. The 
real officials who will only pretend to resist. 

e. Criminal investigation personnel 

Remove incriminating evidence from the scene of acts of sabo¬ 
tage or assassination attempts. 

Mislead elements of the enemy State Security Service. For in¬ 
stance, blame the incident on a traitor who will then be neutralized. 
Misplace, steal and destroy any evidence. Warn persons who become 
suspects. 

Priests 

Destroy or hide all lists of religious groups and associations in 
your possession; otherwise they will be used by the enemy to draw 
up lists of individuals to be held as hostages and to be deported. 

If activities such as church services, baptism rites, communion, 
confirmation, etc., are prohibited by the new dictators—which will 
happen for certain sooner or later—take up a “fictitious profession.” 
The most desirable cover would be one which would allow you to 
travel a great deal such as an errand boy, a meter reader for gas 
and electric companies, fund raiser for any organization, an insurnce 
agent, etc. 

You will thus be able to continue your ministry “under cover” 
simply by visiting the people individually instead of having them 
come to your church. They will also feed you and support your 
family so that you will be able to select the “fictitious profession” 
based on above rules without having to take into consideration the 
salary. 

Kindergarten nurses, teachers 

Without doubt you will have the most difficult task. On one 


1 A&lt;1 



hand instruct ion material such ns new school books and schedules 
are strictly regulated and supervised by the occupying powers, and 
on the other hand you are in a key position in which you should 
sabotage enemy efforts more than anyone else. This is a fight for 
the mind of the youth. I can give you little advice at this time. 

Enemy efforts will concentrate primarily in the following areas: 

(1) Children will be instructed to report any unfriendly re¬ 
marks made about the regime. The final goal is to have an informer 
(the child) in each family so that parents and sisters and brothers 
will he watched. Possible counter-measures: Emphasize and cultivate 
the family’s feeling of loyally to one another. 

(2) Attempts will be made to misrepresent and change history. 

(3) Efforts will be made to degrade and neutralize all former 
democratic institutions and principles. 

(1) The enemy will supplant instruction in citizenship with his 
own ideology and party doctrine. 

(5) All instruction such as reading, writing, arithmetic, history, 
geography, etc., will be systematically saturated with politics. The 
first words which the young student will spell or write will be party 
slogans of the enemy. 

(6) Such words as peace, freedom, democracy will be so twisted 
and distorted that the younger generation will no longer know what 
they really mean. 

(7) The occupation power will force students to learn its lan¬ 
guage. 

(8) Religion will he ridiculed. Attempts will be made to dis¬ 
prove religious beliefs by dishonest presentation of scientific fact. 

10) A personality cult will be developed and nurtured. 

Counter such measures by cultivating the ability to judge criti¬ 
cally and emphasizing human values, such as loyalty, friendship, 
readiness to help. 

I am fully aware that I did not offer many concrete solutions. 
However, with mere general phrases you are not offered any help. 
As mentioned above, this is the most difficult and almost the most 
important problem. It therefore stands to reason that you should 
think about these questions thoroughly and discuss them with col¬ 
leagues. Perhaps you will find the solutions which I am unable to 
offer here. A group often finds a solution more easily than an indi¬ 
vidual. 



Engineers and technicians in industrial plants 

Make mistakes during construction. Institute changes at the onset 
of mass production. Mismanage the supply of spare parts. 

Employees in plants and shops 

Work slowly. Turn out poor quality goods and produce many 
rejects. Take a break often. Treat machinery, installations and engines 
carelessly. Cause excessive waste. Use excessive quantities of water, 
power, fuel and grease. Take excessive Bick leave. 

Engineers, architects, and builders 

Make excessively high estimates of materials needed which ore 
in short supply such as cement, reinforcing rods, etc. Charge the 
highest prices possible. Extend construction periods as long as possi- 
ble. Cooperate with your colleagues in this effort. 

Construction workers 

If you have to build fortifications, obstacles, billets, roads, etc., 
for the enemy, you will be able to mix in considerably more cement 
than necessary for the requirement can be calculated exactly. Cement 
is always in short supply and a systematic great increase in consump¬ 
tion would inevitably lead to shortages for the enemy. On the other 
hand, you can reduce the quality of the product by adding too little 
cement. 

When putting insufficient quantities of cement into the concrete 
to weaken the structure, throw the remaining cement away in order 
to give the appearance of having used up the calculated amount and 
to preclude u reduction in amount of cement allocated for the project. 
Work as negligently, slowly, and poorly as possible. 

Taxi drivers 

Always use a circuitous route to gel to the destination to cause 
the enemy the greatest loss in time and highest cost possible. Pre¬ 
tend not to be familiar with the route. 

When enemy personnel indicate they are in a hurry to make a 
train or attend a meeting, fake a breakdown and cause him to be late. 

Streetcar conductors and bus drivers 

Close the doors in front of the nose of occupation personnel and 
their followers when they attempt to enter. Ignore enemy personnel 
waiting at bus stops. Keep on driving. Ignore the enemy’s signals 
to stop the streetcar or bus when he wants off. Your fellow citizens 


136 



will gladly walk back or wait for the next bus or streetcar if the 
enemy can be harrassed. 

Vehicle mechanic 

There are many ways in which you can impair the effectiveness 
of the enemy’s vehicles. Set the engine to increase gasoline consump¬ 
tion. When changing oil, secretly fill the crankcase with old oil. Fill 
radiator with insufficient amount of anti-freeze. Make out oil and 
grease tickets incorrectly so as to cause increased oil and grease con¬ 
sumption or usage of the vehicle. Crease vehicle badly or not at all. 

Gas station attendent 

Throw sugar into the gas tank which will result in a breakdown, 
search for cause of breakdown, und an unpleasant repair job. 

When filling tanks out of separate canisters, pour diesel oil into 
gasoline-operated vehicles and vice versa. This results in breakdown, 
unplcasunt repair jobs. As an excuse, you can say you simply made 
a mistake in the cans. When checking tires, put in too much or too 
little air. In one case the weur of tires will increase, in the other the 
suspension system will be strained too much. 

Artisan 

When you are called up for a repair job, pretend you have 
too much work on hand and put off the job as long as possible. Only 
use inferior material. Churge an exhorbitant price. 

Owners of radio shops 

All radios wilf be confiscated by the enemy sooner or later. 
Consequently, you must put aside a stock of spure parts which will 
be needed by the resistance movement and guerrilla units. 

Hide ull portable radios; this can be easily done due to their 
small size. Also stock up on batteries for the same. 

Salesgirls in grocery stores 

Intentionally overlook members of the occupation forces and 
collaborators to cause them to complain in order to be served at 
all. If you have to answer for your behavior, present profuse ex¬ 
cuses in order to repeal the same tactics with the next member. 

Make a point to give them the worst of everything, such as 
partially rotten fruit, vegetables, salads and the smallest pieces of 
meat, bread, etc. 

Intentionally damuge any merchandise he requests. Squeeze fruit 



before packing it. Put down paper bag heavily on counter, so that 
fruit will be bruised and therefore spoil quickly. 

Salesgirls in department stores 

Sell him impractical articles such as souvenirs, watches, jewelry, 
clothes, shoes, etc. Sell him damaged or faulty merchandise or objects. 
Damage merchandise or objects he buys prior to packing them. For 
instance cut into a piece of cloth, put gTease or paint on it. Assert 
that certain items he asks for are no longer in stock. If he proves 
the contrary, indicate you are sorry you made a mistake. 

Catering business 

(1) Waiters and waitresses in hotels, restaurants 

Continue to ignore the enemy so that he has to complain in 
order to be served at all. Take his order as inattentively, slowly and 
indifferently as possible. Always give him the worst of everything 
such as the worst wine at the highest price, etc. 

(2) Owner 

Encourage your personnel to act as outlined above by ignoring 
complaints of the enemy. Assign foreign military personel or traitors 
the worst rooms you can. 

There are problems and dangers for artisans and shop owners, 
butchers, bakers, department stores, tailors, shoe repairmen, repair 
shops, who harass the enemy in ways mentioned above. 

All of the above procedures of passive resistance will only be 
successful when all shop owners and artisans cooperate so that the 
enemy or his followers cannot simply run to a competitor. 

You must all present one solid front. He who fails to cooperate 
with this front because of greed shall be considered a collaborator 
and will be called to account for his actions after liberation. 

The temptation for the individual to profit greatly by this 
“voluntary elimination” of competition and to be the only one to 
do a lucrative business is very great. 

The resistance movement must clearly explain to these egotists 
that such activity is treason and that nothing will be forgotten nor 
forgiven. 

F armers 

In the “occupied” area, a delivery quota will be very quickly 
imposed. Deliveries of grain, potatoes, fruit, dairy products, pigs and 
cattle can be estimated accurately which will prevent you from 
concealing almost anything at all. However, overproduce as much 



as possible in other sectors such as garden vegetables, sheep, goats, 
chickens and rabbits. 

Use these surplus products for the guerrilla units as well as for 
personnel gone “underground.” The finance section of the resistance 
movement as well as headquarters of guerrilla units will pay you as 
much as they possibly can. 

In temporarily “liberated” areas deliver the entire harvest volun¬ 
tarily to guerrilla detachments. It is better to have it in the hands 
of our own people than to have the enemy profit by it. If you don’t, 
everything will be confiscated by the enemy under the pretext “of 
having helped the partisans” once the guerrilla units are forced to 
leave and your area becomes enemy occupied territory again. 

Retain only what you need for yourself (self-supply, seeds for 
coming year.l You can always claim that the harvest was taken 
away by force by the partisans. 

Harvest lime is also time for a “major offensive” by the 
guerrilla units who will attempt to liberate as large and as rich an 
area as possible to prevent the enemy from getting the harvest and 
at the same time increasing their own supply for the coming winter. 

It is obvious, of course, that you must assist in these efforts. 
If your area is under enemy occupation, slow down the harvest in 
hopes that a guerrilla unit will arrive in time to take the grain or 
produce from the enemy. 

Speed up the harvest if you are in a “liberated” area so that 
it can be stored and the surplus given to guerrilla units so that they 
can hide it before the enemy begins a counter-offensive. 

Make your own transportation means available—horses, tractors, 
carts—to transport harvest surpluses to guerrilla caches and depots. 

“Infiltration' of Armed Party Organizations 

The enemy will soon create an armed factory militia in im¬ 
portant industrial plants, the transportation system and administra¬ 
tion. 

In their effort to create a “mass organization” and to flatter the 
foreign dictator and master with impressive figures, the new powers 
will be unable to find sufficient members really true to the party line. 
Consequently, they will be forced to fill their thin ranks with many 
others less dedicated and politically reliable. 

Here you will find great opportunities to infiltrate the enemy 
organization. 

Leading positions as well as members of crew-served weapons 
will, based on past experience, always be filled by absolutely de- 



pcndable party members, whereas the unreliable will be assigned 
lower missions such as ammunition bearer, rifle men, etc. 

By infiltrating members of the resistance movement into these 
armed fighting organizations of the party, you will be able to do 
the following during a decisive hour: 

(1) Dispose of weapons and ammunition; 

(2) Reduce the fighting strength of these units by mediocre 
cooperation; 

(3) Be informed of their measures and thus reveal and thwart 
them; 

(4) Shoot the “party fanatics” in the back at an opportune 
moment and then join the population. 

Final remarks 

During passive resistance the individual needle prick is useless 
as such. However, thousands such pricks together will create un¬ 
bearable conditions for the enemy. The decisive factor is to unite 
the citizenry and to maintain resistance over a long period. 

Each time you are able to perform a jabbing operation you 
will feel a small triumph and notice that after all you are not so de¬ 
fenseless. These small personal victories will increase your fighting 
spirit and will to resist. 

Do not forget the first and foremost rule: “Seek connections 
with and support of persons thinking the same as you. He who is 
lonely and isolated will lose his belief in his own strength and in the 
victory of the good cause.” 

The enemy will be in a position, of course, to make passive 
resistance more difficult by increased control. However, he will be 
unable to eliminate it completely. Only when a supervisor is placed 
behind each working member will the enemy be able to forestall 
this resistance. And even then you succeed. 

17. Sabotage 

During sabotage it is of importance to be able to get to the 
heart of the installation. The simplest way is to obtain a suitable 
job. Sometimes you will be able to influence workers to carry out 
sabotage, other times you will have to infiltrate members of the 
resistance movement into the target area. 

Individuals in administrative and office capacities can best 
hinder the enemy by a “slowdown” campaign. This is relatively 
safe. The work pace is simply reduced drastically automatically caus¬ 
ing a reduction in the production output. 


140 



In highly industrialized, automated plants where the pulse and 
tempo of the production process are dictated by the machine, so to 
speak, delaying tactics arc difficult to apply. On the other hand, you 
will find many opportunities to sabotage machinery, and instruments. 

A small breakdown will bring the entire highly complicated pro¬ 
duction process to a standstill. 

General sabotage possibilities 

Activate air raid sirens through sabotage. The false alarm will 
have everyone running to air raid shelters and will interrupt the 
entire public life for hours. After the all clear signal, you will then 
return slowly to your job in order to waste as much time as possible. 

Take advantage of a chaos after air raids. After air raids you 
will he able to destroy important machinery and appliances which

Threats posed by planes and long-range

involved either directly or indirectly in con¬ 
tributing to the production of one item. If only 
one is put out of oction the entire production 
process will be delayed. The more atomic 
weopons enfore a decentralization in rear 
areas, the more the production will become 
vulnerable to sabotage. Even in this secondary 
area, modem weapons increase the effectiveness 
of guerrilla warfare, as paradoxical as it may 
sound. Atomic weapons increase the value of 
the partisan and the resistance fighter. 



have survived the attack. You can do this during the general con¬ 
fusion under the cover of attempting to render assistance. You thus 
will be able to get to important targets which normally are out of 
your reach. Demolition and Are fighting personnel of the resistance 
movement are able to carry out missions of destruction during and 
after heavy night bombing attacks. 

They may disguise themselves in uniform or coveralls of the 
fire department and civil air defense organization. These missions 
will go unnoticed and thus unpunished in the general chaos. Raids 
and attacks can also be conducted at this favorable time. 

Prisons that have been damaged can be attacked by raiding 
patrols of the resistance movement to free the prisoners. 

18. Raids Conducted by the Civilian Resistance Movement. 

In certain exceptional cases the resistance movement will have 
to resort to raids. It may be necessary to free imprisoned resistance 
fighters from police stations, interrogation cellars and, if necessary, 
even prisons if the danger exists that they might reveal important 
facts under torture. It also may be necessary to free hostages, capture 
files or destroy key industrial installations and transportation facili¬ 
ties. 

Organization of Raid: 

Phase One: Preparations 

Since the State Security Service will search for the participants 
of the raid, all must have an alibi for staying away from work with¬ 
out attracting attention or suspicion. Pretending to be ill is the best 
way. Symptoms of illness reported to the office of a plant by co- 
workers must later coincide with the doctor’s report issued by a 
doctor belonging to the underground movement. 

In a larger city the sewage system will have to be prepared as 
a hiding place should things go wrong. It should be stocked with 
food, beverages, first aid equipment, extra clothes, ammunition, maps, 
etc. 

A detailed reconnaissance of target area must be performed. 
Routes of withdruwul must be demgnuled and prepared. 

Phase Two: 

Fire support elements must take over houses neighboring the 
turget. For this purpose apartments and shops may have to be rented. 
If necessary, .fire support elements may have to occupy these places 
several days before the operation and live there. 


143 



Unassembled submachine guns, light machine guns, assault 
guns, pistols, hand grenades and ammunition can be transported to 
the selected positions in briefcases, tool boxes, or suitcases. 

A courier service must be organized; women, young boys and 
girls are especially suited for this job. 

The raiding party conducting the operation can benefit from the 
black-out. Anyone still on the street after curfew is automatically 
considered an enemy. The raiding parly will wear shoes with rubber 
soles, dark clothes and will blacken face and hands. 

By virtue of the fact that the population has to stay inside after 
curfew, you may use your weapons more ruthlessly than during the 
day since no innocent people will be on the streets. 

During the day, the raiding party will best be loaded onto a 
covered truck and will then drive directly in front of the target. 
When the raiding parly detrucks, this will automatically signal for 
fire support elements to open fire from their preparod positions. 

Possible methods of sealing of routes of access to target area: 

Resistance members pose as street cleaners. “Street cleaners” 
can be used in an excellent manner as security guards; they will 
hide submachine guns and hand grenades in their carts; or else 
you can use “mechanics” carrying their weapons in their tool boxes. 

Block routes of access by simulating a traffic accident. The 
driver involved can escape in the confusion created in this manner. 
The “accident,” which will take place when the raiding party has 
opened fire, will prevent police from arriving too soon. The driver, 
should he be apprehended, can explain that he was scared and thus 
caused the accident. 

Phase Three: Wilhdrawal 

Plans will have to include provisions for withdrawal after a 
successful operation or discontinuation of operation if the target 
cannot be reuched. Concealed personnel with submachine guns, mines 
and prepared road blocks will be used to keep routes of withdrawal 
open. It may be necessury to disappear in the sewer system and wait 
until the search operation, which may go on for several days, has 
been discontinued. 

Methods of covering withdrawal: 

If you use motor vehicles you must install armor in back of 
the driver’s seat to prevent the driver from being hit by bullets from 
pursuing vehicles. Since only light weapons, i.e., pistols, submachine 
guns and perhaps automatic rifles, and no armor piercing bullets 
will be used, a steel plate about 10 millimeters thick will suffice. In- 


1'14 



stall several sand bags or perhaps an additional low steel plate 10 
millimeters thick and 50 to 60 centimeters high at the rear end of 
the truck to protect personnel lying on the floor. Pursuing elementa 
can he discouraged with hand grenades and submachine guns. 

You may establish road blocks along the planned routes of 
approach. Members of the resistance movement on road blocks, may 
use a variety of methods to stop your pursuers.

street. 

In order for personnel manning these road blocks to be able 
to recognize your vehicle at night from those of the enemy, you must 
agree upon a sign, i.e., a red flashlight shining from the driver’s seat, 
etc.

Booby trapping the road block will cause the enemy losses, 
assuming he can slop in time to clear the obstacle. He will suffer 
more casualties from booby trups than usual since being in hot 
pursuit and wanting to clear the Btreet quickly he will be careless. 

19. The Last Phase of Resistance: General Uprising. 

The revolt of the Maquis in France (especially Paris) with 
the approach of the allies and of the Polish underground forces led 
by General Bor in Warsaw are good historical examples of a mass 
uprising. 

A general uprising speeds up the collapse of the enemy. 

Success depends upon the selection of the right time. If you 
initiate the attack too soon, the uprising will fail. If you act too 
late you will miss your chance. 

The moment for general uprising arrives when the enemy has 
been put on the defensive by events far away. Your efforts will be 
assisted by the approaching allied armies who may provide assistance, 
by the enemy sending some occupation units elsewhere or by his 
voluntarily withdrawing from your area. 

In addition to advantages of a purely technical nature, such 
as preventing large scule destruction, dismantling of industry, 
etc., open uprisings will provide you with other advantages which 
should not be underestimated. For instance, your position in regards 
to the world political situation and likelihood of maintaining the 
sovereignty of your country will be much better after the war if 
you are able to reconquer large portions of your country yourself, 
rather than waiting passively for liberation and salvation by foreign 
countries. 

With a little luck you may be able to get by with indirect help 
during the liberation campaign such as air support, supply of weapons 
and ammunition, etc., provided by allied armies and thus you may 
not need the help of their ground forces. This way you can also 
prevent your country from being occupied again even though by 
friendly forces. Past experience shows that even “allies” and “liber¬ 
ators” cannot be removed so easily. At least, it’s harder to get them 
to leave than to enter. 

And finally, at the end of the war, you will immediately have 
your own army again, even though primitive, which will form the 
basis for a new, better force. 

During the phase of the “open uprising” the civilian resistance 
movement will serve as the stationary, local troops of the towns espe- 



ciully lor key trallic installations, whereas the guerrilla units will 
serve as the mobile fighting forces. 

The idea is to block the enemy’s internal routes of communica¬ 
tion and route of withdrawal by open insurrection of the popula¬ 
tion and to smash the enemy retreating in the intermediate area or 
getting ready to free the blocked communication routes with the 
mobile guerrilla units. 

It is obvious, of course, that maximum use has to he made of 
the terruin. Concentrate uprisings in large towns and cities which 
will be difficult for the enemy to suppress. Mobile guerrilla forces 
in the intermediate area will attack at favorable terrain features such 
as ravines, so that the enemy will be unable to utilize his superior 
force or at leusl not be able to commit them at the same time. Mobile 
units should conduct attacks in at least batallion strength. 

Even though fighting in unfavorable terrain, the enemy must 
be under attack from two sides. For instance, if he is attempting to 
suppress an insurrection in a city, guerrilla units should attack his 
Hanks or rear. 

Tactics oj uprising 

a. Preparations: 

Procure a lot of city maps for yourself and your subordinate 
leaders. During city fighting they pluy the same role as maps for 
operations in the open terrain. 

At important tactical places you must lease apartments, shops 
or even houses where you can take up position long beforehand, 
i.e., at bridges, intersections, train stations, telephone offices, exit 
routes, etc. 

Make a reconnaissance of church steeples and high houses which 
can be used as observation posts. Prepare and camouflage them. For 
instance, install telephone lines which will only require connecting 
during the hour of decision. 

At important locations you can prepare cellar windows, etc., 
as machine gun and anti-tank positions and camouflage them. For 
instance, install weapons racks at appropriate height to support 
weapons. Obtain sand bags to stabilize tripods or bipods or to rein¬ 
force walls. At the last moment all you have to do is place the weapons 
in position. 

In this manner you already have some trumps in your hands 
when the uprising breaks out. 

b. Occupation of town: 

Similar procedures will be used as mentioned in the chapter on 



laclics ot Guerrilla Units.” However, here the difference is that 
the participants in this case are members of “fighting groups” of 
the civilian resistance movement and not of the guerrilla units. In 
addition, depots, munition and arms factories will also have to be 
occupied. 

c. Defense of towns: 

You must primarily anticipate counter-attacks by tanks. The 
mobile reserve units of the occupation forces consist mostly of 
mechanized police regiments with attached . tank elements. 

Seal off communications within the town. The enemy will thus ' 
be able to make use of his superior means—artillery, tanks, planes— 
only on a restricted scale. 

Your forces will be such'—even with complete assistance of the 
entire population—that you will be unable to occupy all buildings. 
Militarily speaking this is not necessary. Establish strong points ut 
the most important traffic junctions, bridges, train stations, inter¬ 
section of main routes, etc. The area in between the individual strong 
points will be patrolled by combat patrols. 

Conduct large-scale reconnaissance all over town at all times by 
using the civilian population—especially women, young boys and 
girls. As a result, you will never be surprised by the enemy. 

Form a main reserve unit ahd motorize it with trucks, captured 
armored personnel carriers. 

Distribution of forces available: 

Personnel (armed fighters); &gt;/j at strong points, J4 i n raiding 
parties, 1/2 in main reserve. 

Ammunition and weapons: 

1. At strong points: 

Concentrate all machine guns, snipers, Molotov cocktails, ex¬ 
plosives and mines for anti-tank defense, approximately 1 /5 of 
ammunition available, approximately 1 /5 of hand grenades on hand. 

2. Raiding parties: 

They should possess the majority of submachine guns and anti¬ 
tank weapons, approximately 1/5 of ammunition available, approxi¬ 
mately 3/5 of hand grenades available, and all anti-tank or rifle 
grenades. 

3. Main reserve: 

Main reserve should have all captured AP carriers and tanks, 
all light machine guns and rocket launchers, approximately 3/5 of 
ammunition available, and approximately 1/5 of hand grenades 
available. 


150 



If the enemy bypasses these strong points and reroutes traffic 
via secondary streets through a town, act as follows: 

Install individual, well camouflaged snipers on roofs, top floors 
and rooms located up high. Practically invisible and out of reach, 
they can disturb the rerouted enemy traffic with well-aimed fire. 

Conduct reconnaissances with the aid of the population. Infil¬ 
trate through these gaps with raiding parties to get to the bypasses. 

Consolidation of strong points: 

Use the population to help you. Your greatest trump is the mass 
utilization of desperate human masses to give the last they have. 
With their help you will be able to convert your strong points into 
fortresses in a period of hours rather than days. 

Work plans, lists of material, order of priority for various 
projects and supervisory personnel for the work forces have to be 
determined down to the smallest detail prior to the uprising. 

The masses of people not belonging to the active fighting groups 
of the resistance movement must fill sand bags. They can use jute 
bags and fill them with dirt, sand, etc. 

Install wire meshing in basement and first-floor windows of 
houses to be used as strong points against hand grenades.

Internal organization of strong points: 

Each strong point will consist of two or three buildings together. 

Only occupy buildings of solid construction such as schools, 
administration buildings, factories, etc. Avoid modern brick build¬ 
ings. Reinforced steel structures or older houses (author refers to 
stone houses common in Switzerland) best withstand the fire from 
tank guns. 

The various buildings composing the strong points must be able 
to give each other lire support and together control an important 
point such as bridges, road intersection, or square. 

The tank obstacle must be installed in such a manner so as to 
be able to be covered by the entire strong point organization. 

Your field of lire must be such that at least two sides of each 
occupied building can be covered by lire from the neighboring 
house. 

A small reserve force of four to five men belongs in each strong 
point. 

20. Fighting Techniques Utilized by the Superior Enemy 

While Surpassing Uprisings. 

Entering towns in the area of the uprising 

The enemy will select primarily the early morning hours between 
0200 and 0400 hours. The last “night revellers” will then have gone 
to bed and those who have to go to the early shift have not yet got 
up. Towns and villages are thus surprised “in bed” so to speak. 

If for any reason at all the morning hours cannot be taken ad¬ 
vantage of, for instance, transportation difficulties, he will select 
the late forenoon hours (1000-1100) when the masses are at work. 

While he is entering, the civilian telephone system will be dis¬ 
rupted to prevent you from reporting his strength, organization and 
direction of advance via the civilian net to your underground move¬ 
ment. 



Siege—Martial law 

Immediately after entry into the area of unrest the enemy will 
declare martial law. You also must know something about this so 
as not to be surprised and impressed too much. 

a. Taking over command: 

A military command will take over in place of the civilian occu¬ 
pation administration or the “puppet administration” and will insti¬ 
tute the following: 

b. Individual measures: 

Restaurants and clubs will be forced to close before dusk. 

Curfew at night. In his own interest the enemy has to issue 
“passes” valid for the curfew hours to doctors as well as employees 
most needed in public installations such as gas works, power works, 
water supply, hospitals, etc. By clever falsifications you may be able 
to get a hold of such passes and thus be able to circulate more or less 
freely as a member of the resistance movement. Here is a wide-open 
field for the activities of the counterfeit section. 

Congregations of more than ten persons will be prohibited. Clubs 
and associations will be prohibited. Court-martials and quick trials 
will be initiated. It will be announced publically that anyone appre¬ 
hended with a weapon will be shot on the spot. 

All house owners and janitors are responsible that house doors, 
cellar and attic doors are closed at all times. Strangers may only 
enter after a check. The house owner or janitor will be jointly re¬ 
sponsible for any hostile acts committed by these strangers against 
the occupation forces from their house (basic rule: each is to watch 
and shadow the other out of fear and self-preservation). 

All shutters and blinds facing the street must be open. However, 
all windows must be closed. Patrols will fire into open windows with¬ 
out any warning. 

c. Proclamation of siege: 

A state of siege will be advertised by posters, loudspeakers, 
trucks, radios and leaflets dropped from planes. 

Reconnaissance prior to the attack 

The occupation forces will conduct a reconnaissance prior to 
cleaning up an area of unrest or putting down an uprising. This 
reconnaissance will not only concern the military sector but the 
political as well. 

You must fight this enemy reconnaissance. However, your mis¬ 
sion will be made more difficult by the fact that enemy reconnaissance 
elements will work primarily in civilian clothes. They will be com- 

155 



posed of members of the political police (State Security Service), 
officers of the occupation army, followers -and collaborators. 

The enemy will, of course, not work in patrols but will work for 
the most part alone. 

The reconnaissance is to clear the following points: 

a. Political situation: 

What sympathies, what support and what practical cooperation 
do the active insurgents have among the masses of the population? 

What is the attitude of their own civilian government, i.e., 
puppet administration, composed of former members of the Fifth 
Column? Is it still “firm” or has it reached the opinion that the 
“moment” has come “to change sides”? 

b. Military situation: 

Evaluate the number of weapons and amount of ammunition 
available to the insurgents. Determine if they have heavy infantry 
weapons such as machine guns and mortars, and anti-tank weapons 
such as mines, rocket launchers, and AT rifles. 

Do they make a good and cohesive impression or is their organi¬ 
zation loose and improvised? Are they cleverly led according to 
military principles which would indicate that they have former 
officers and NCO’s leading them or do they act like amateurs? 

Do they build obstacles? Do they occupy positions? Are there 
good roads of access for entering the town? What is a rough estimate 
(border lines) of area of unrest? 

At least find out roughly in what part of the city the head¬ 
quarters of the uprising is located. 

You will see at once from the above that the reconnaissance of 
the political situation almost takes precedence over the military 
sector; at least it ranks equally important. Consequently, the enemy 
reconnaissance elements should be able to judge human beings and 
present matter-of-fact opinions in their delicate missions. Since they 
arc party fanatics, however, they will see everything in a different 
light. The ability to make critical judgments is mostly lacking in 
them since they were educated according to a strict doctrine. As a 
result, reconnaissance results will at least lack something in the 
political sector which is of advantage to you, i.e., poor estimate of 
situation by enemy leaders. 

Along with the reconnaissance the enemy will attempt to secure 
plans or maps of the city. These will render the enemy good services 
during city fights due to his lack of knowledge of the area and he 
will attempt to procure these in quantities. You must remove them. 
A systematic collection of these plans is one of the first missions of 

156 



a careful preparation for an uprising. By means of specially desig¬ 
nated sections you will have these plans removed from the following 
places: city planning office (surface and subsurface constructions), 
book stores, stationery stores, and official map sales stores. 

The securing of plans on the sewage system also is part of this 
operation. (See also booklet entitled “Fighting Techniques,” Vol. II, 
page 32-35, with illustrations and directives on the fight in the sewage 
system, published by the Central Secretariat of the Swiss NCO Associ¬ 
ation, Biel). 

Based upon the results of the reconnaissance, the occupation 
forces will establish a plan (operations plan). It basically has two 
possibilities: 


Planned, rather demonstrative 
entry. 


This is to serve to cause people 
to come to their senses. Mostly 
used during rather advanced un¬ 
rests. Will give you time for 
counter-measures. 


Surprise, raid-like attack. 



counter-measures. Mostly used 
during weak uprisings. Occupa¬ 
tion forces must improvise and 
risk the danger of repercussions. 


The enemy will commit as large a troop contingent as possible 
so as not to suffer any defeat for such an event would greatly enhance 
the insurgent movement and drive many undecided and careful 
persons into the arms of the active fighters. 

Sealing off an area o/ unrest by the occupation forces 

a. General 

Armored and mechanized troops encircle the city by closing 
off the main arterial roads, in order to prevent an escape of the 
insurgents, and to prevent help and supplies from reaching the in¬ 
surgents from the outside. 

Individual armored raiding groups will attack along main routes 
in the direction of the center of the city in order to occupy individual, 
important points and split up the insurgents Into several, separate 
fighting groups. 

Most of the enemy infantry will comb the various city sections, 
blocks and buildings slowly and systematically. 

A motorized main reserve will be kept ready outside the town 
in order to counter attempts to break out, relieve tired units, replace 


157 








T ^»iq«es owd by 




losses, reinforce, if necessary, (he spearhead units, and to eliminate 
later especially tenaciously defended pockets of resistance. Coordina¬ 
tion and direction of the operation will be facilitated by radio, 
helicopter and light planes. 

b. Detailed organization 

The occupation powers will organize basically their units as 
follows: “forces to seal off”; outer perimeter; inner perimeter; and 
“mopping-up forces.” 

All forces (military, party militia, regular police forces, State 
Security Service) are placed under one command.

haps police general of State

Service 


“Outer Perimeter force”: Will prevent unauthorized traffic in the 
area of the uprising (rerouting traffic). Will protect 
mopping-up forces against operations from the outside, 
i.e., attacks from guerrilla units supporting the insurgents. 
Main clement of the outer sealing-off force is the party 
militia supported by individual policemen who regulate 
traffic and “screen” persons and vehicles passing through. 
Individual tanks and infantry elements of the occupation 
power serve as a battle-ready back-up force. The “outer 
seal-off force” only blocks main routes of access at the 
periphery of the area of uprising. This is a tight little 
net which can be easily bypassed by using secondary 
roads. 


“Inner Perimeter force”: Will prevent escape of insurgents. Thus is as 
tight and close as possible. Main tactical element is the 
infantry. Areas with wide field of fire (parks, canals, 
large streets, open squares) are selected to save on per¬ 
sonnel for the sealing-off operation since combing the 
area thoroughly requires many personnel. 


159 



“Mopping-up forces”: Raiding elements—infantry and individual 
armored personnel carriers—will knock out pockets of 
resistance. Fire support elements will assist the advance 
of the raiding elements, i.e., self-propelled guns, tanks, 
mortars, machine guns. Search detachments will consist 
of infantry, as well as specialists of the State Security 
Service. Reserves will support the attack as well as guard 
and transport prisoners. 

The enemy assembly area 

The enemy likes to use open, easily controllable areas (RR 
marshalling yards, larger inconnecting parks, etc.) as assembly areas. 
He will be able to do this since you do not possess any heavy weapons 
(artillery, planes, mortars) to smash known assembly areas and troop 
concentrations. Assembly in open and easily controlled area will 
make it easier for the enemy to assemble and organize his units, brief 
subordinate unit commanders on the terrain and position heavy

will not be able to be effective from narrow streets. 

Thus remember: Large open areas near your defensive front 
are dangerous. As long as you still have freedom of movement you 
must position yourself in such a manner that such areas (parks, 
open spaces, railroad tracks) are to your rear. Where you have 
been unable to do this your few mortars must be able to concentrate 
on these points.

Point of penetration on enemy 

The tactical rule in city fighting is to select the point of penetra¬ 
tion in such a way so that the depth of the area to be penetrated is 
as short as possible. 

You must continually enter on your situation map any reports 
about newly installed enemy sealing-off posts. As time goes on you 
will obtain a pretty good picture of the development of the inner 
perimeter. You can now easily see where-the area occupied by you 
shows the smallest depth. You must assume rather safely that the 
enemy will attack at this point. Make your preparations accordingly 
by increasing observation at this point, relocating reserves, etc. 

Advance in streets 

The enemy will normally use a reinforced company for each 
main street. 

Two platoons will probably advance together next to each other; 
one on the street itself, the other via gardens and backyards. The 
enemy will select that side of the street which offers the best cover. 
The third platoon follows as reserve, sealing off and searching the 
area. 

On the main street, one squad will advance in file to the left 
and right along the houses. One squad will follow as reserve on 
the side which provides the most cover. One or two tanks or assault 
guns will advance with the infantry to provide fire support. 

At least one squad of the reserve platoon will be committed on 
both sides to search the houses passed by the lead platoon to prevent 
a flare-up of the fight in the rear.'Individual officials of the State 
Security Service are also assigned to the reserve platoon as specialists. 
Since a search of houses requires more time than the advance of the 
lead element, the reserve platoon will dictate the speed of advance. 
When the lead element engages in a fire fight, personnel further back 
in the column will step 'behind and into houses to prevent losses. 

The advance will halt at each street intersecting the direction of 
advance and the unit will regroup. You can see by the above that 
the advance of the enemy will be very difficult and, above all, time- 
consuming. 

Eliminating barricades 

The enemy will attempt to destroy barricades from a great 
distance by using his superior heavy weapons, i.e., tanks, assault 
guns, direct artillery fire.

Where you have so installed your barricades in such a manner 
to prevent this, the enemy will never attack the barricade frontally 
but advance to the left and right through the houses with infantry 
(raiding parties). The barricade will then fall almost by itself. 

Clearing large buildings by the occupation forces 

The entire area concerned will be surrounded. Routes of access 
will be closed off by barbed wire (concertina wire) and soldiers with 










submachine guns. Tanks will drive up and guard the buildings con¬ 
cerned with machine gun and canon. Automatic weapons will be 
positioned in and on the neighboring buildings to control the roofs 
of the target area.

An assault party, i.e., elements of the State Security Service, 
penetrates into the buildings, searches and cleans them out systemati¬ 
cally. Suspicious persons and prisoners will be taken away immedi¬ 
ately. Trucks and officials of the State Security Service will be kept 
ready for the transportation of prisoners. A reserve element will 
wait under cover in order to handle arrested persons or reinforce 
the assault element. Loudspeakers will broadcast announcements and 
appeals to the “enemy.” Searchlights will be positioned to assist 
the operation at night, if necessary.

into the houses but at the same time make it difficult for the escapees 
to lire from closed windows upon troops and police. 

b. Keep many streets open on purpose to provide the crowds 
with avenues of escape. 

c. Clear the square from only one side, selecting that side from 
which the least streets lead into the square. 

In order to clear the square, the enemy will use primarily tanks, 
armored personnel carriers or at least trucks. They will advance 
slowly in one line at consistent pace—often with one flank slightly 
ahead which facilitates observation—and thus push back the crowd. 

Infantry will be mounted on the vehicles to prevent the crowd 
from tearing down antennas, tools, flags, etc., from the vehicles or 
throw Molotov cocktails at them. 

Behind the tanks follow reserve elements at some distance with 
trucks. They have the mission: 

To close off immediately side streets passed by the tanks with 
movable wire obstacles and guards to prevent portions of the crowd 
from returning and attacking the rear of the clearing elements. 

To take charge of persons arrested and transport them to the 
rear in trucks. 

Occupation of a city after uprisings are suppressed 

After entry and clearing operations are completed, “restricted 
areas” will be established which will support the occupation troops. 
In these areas the occupation troops will be strictly separated from 
the population. This way the troops can be protected and removed 
from the political influence of the population. 

Areas adjacent to “restricted areas” will be patrolled by infantry 
and tanks. Infantry patrols will hide in armored personnel carriers, 
if possible, or at least on trucks carrying machine guns. 

Strong points will be established in the adjacent areas to support 
the patrols. They will be few in number so as not to disperse forces, 
but will be able to withstand attack. 

They are always installed in solid buildings which can be easily 
defended. Often they will be situated in places which have to be 
guarded anyhow, i.e., power companies, arsenals, bridges, etc. 

Patrols will be led by officers. Only within the immediate vicinity 
of the restricted area (several hundred meters) are these patrols of 
squad strength. Otherwise, they will consist at least of one platoon 
with machine gun mounted on a truck. 

Officers leading the patrols are usually the best the enemy has 
to offer (read: “the most ruthless” and “trigger happy”). 


167 



Officers are above all to prevent any contact between the popula¬ 
tion and the soldiers and to make sure that the latter are not disarmed 
by the population. They will not refrain from firing even in the 
presence of women and children. 

Patrols are especially dangerous since they will open fire quick¬ 
ly out of fear; at any rate, sooner than a large closed unit. The 
smaller a patrol and the farther away from the restricted area, the 
sooner it will make ubc of its weapons.

Individual guards along the |&gt;eriphery of the “restricted area” 
will he replaced as soon as possible by barbed wire entanglements. 
This will conserve personnel and will be even more effective. 

Individual guards are always positioned at least 30 meters be¬ 
hind the barbed wire entanglement to prevent them from talking to 
the population. If they have to yell to speak with the people they 
will soon stop. Even more so since comrades and superiors may be 
able to listen to whut is being said. As a result guards arc automati¬ 
cally removed from the political inlluence and distraction of the 
population. Thus the ideological gup is once more guaranteed. 

16 K 



Normally a sign will warn against trespassing beyond the barbed 
wire entanglement. Anyone attempting to cross the line will be fired 
upon ruthlessly and without warning. 

Disarmament 

A certain cut-off date will be set for turning over weapons, 
ammunition, explosives, and hand grenades; until then people are 
assured of not being punished if they turn over these weapons. This 
guarantee will be adhered to at least in the beginning so as not to 
frighten anyone away.

Should you be so trusting and turn over your weapons you will 
be put on a “black list" in spite of everything. The enemy will always 
need hostages or forced laborers later on (read: “work slaves”) and 
will gladly make use of the “black lists.” You see once again that 
you cannot escape his net and had better die fighting. 

After the deadline, raids coupled with house searches and street 
checks w"* 1 . be conducted. 


169 



During a street check, certain streets are closed off all of a 
sudden and pedestrians are searched for weapons. Vehicles and con¬ 
tents are searched. 

There are many ways to dispose of incriminating material when 
caught in a street check. If you carry a pistol, explosives, hand 
grenade, underground newspaper, or leaflets on your person, you 
must act quickly. During the first few minutes after the street has 
been blocked off, general confusion will reign; you must take ad¬ 
vantage of this. About ten minutes later, the enemy will begin to 
collect all pedestrians “caught in the net” and line them up in a 
formation (rows, columns of two) to be able to guard them better. 
Once part of the formation, you will hardly be able to dispose of 
the incriminating material. Your task will be even more complicated 
since the enemy has previously sent in agents and informers of the 
Slate Security Service into the area who allowed themselves to be 
caught as “harmless pedestrians” and who now discreetly watch the 
crowd. 

If you carry the material in a briefcase, a small suitcase or in 
a tool box put it down on the ground as if you were too lazy to 
carry it any longer. Stand next to it fighting boredom for a while 
and then attempt to walk away as if you forgot it. If you are ac¬ 
companied by a friend he can help you by creating a diversion. For 
instance he can look excitedly at a roof, then point at it and call out: 
“There! Someone is doing gymnastics up there! Now he is gone!” 
In the confusion you will move away from the case in order “to be 
able to see better.” 

Smaller objects such as pistols, hand grenades, bundles of leaf¬ 
lets, single newspapers, can be disposed of in the following manner. 
Sit down on the curb near the hole. Several friends may be able to 
stand around you to give you cover and attempt to direct the atten¬ 
tion of others elsewhere. Slide the incriminating object into the 
sewer. 

A garden fence is also very good. Lean against it as if bored. 
Pull out a package of cigarettes and light one. Put the lighter into 
the bag in which you have the material. When you remove your 
hand withdraw the object at the same time, hold your hands behind 
your back and let it slide into the garden through the fence. Even 
here friends may be able to help you by providing cover. 

Attempt later on to recover the object thrown away 1 —especially 
in the case of weapons. Let at least three days go by. The enemy may 
have rigged a trap. 

If you are an innocent bystander and notice that people are 


170 



trying to hide objects, it is your duty to help them as much as you 
can by ignoring their actions, or by contributing in attempts to 
distract attention from them. 

Search of a block of houses 

On the evening before or during the night, a scout in civilian 
clothes (official of the State Security Service, military, etc.) will 
conduct a reconnaissance to determine good routes of approach, 
roadblocks needed, number of personnel required. 

Approach, encirclement and blocking off the area will be done 
at dawn. The enemy will conduct this operation as quickly as possible 
to prevent you from taking counter measures such as organizing 
resistance, hiding out, escaping, etc. 


HotiM-fo-houM w«rch 



The house search begins at daylight before people go to work 
(early shift). 

Whenever possible, movable barriers (concertina wire) will be 
used to conserve personnel. The barrier is to prevent a coming and 
going of persons from one side to the other. At the same time the 
enemy provides security for his search elements by using barriers. 

Buildings standing alone (villas, etc.) do not offer any particular 
difficulties. Row houses, however, are more complicated. Here he 

171 



has at the same time to close off several buildings on both sides of 
the “target.” 

Normally, an infantry squad of ten to twelve men will be ac¬ 
companied by one or two members of the State Security Service. Two 
sentries will be stationed immediately in the attic to prevent escapes 
via roofs. One guard will be posted in the stairwell on each floor; 
he will watch the doors. Three men will be on the bottom floor. One 
each will guard the front and rear house entrance, while the third 
man will guard the entrance to the basement. 



^ Member of occupation troops. 

(J Official of State Security Service. 
^ Inhabitants. 


As a rule, all inhabitants will be herded together in a place 
which can be easily guarded (yard, corner of wall). The owner or 
janitor must indicate if all are present, who is missing and who does 
not belong among the inhabitants. 

Then the inhabitants are called up individually when it is their 
turn to have their apartments searched. Doors which cannot be 
opened will be broken open. The systematic search requires a lot 
of time. In this case the specialists of the State Security Service will 
render good services in various respects. 


The presence alone of the hated and feared organ of the politi¬ 
cal police will have a paralyzing and intimidating effect upon the 
inhabitants. 

The individual soldier, on the inside entirely disinterested in 
the whole operation, is forced to greatest activity and harshness by 
the presence of the representatives of the regime if he does not want 
to run the risk of being considered politically unreliable. 

The following will be searched carefully: small water tanks of 
the various types of toilets, closets, suitcases, boxes, stoves, stove 
pipes (suitable weapons cache), chimneys (hiding places for per¬ 
sons), beds, etc. In addition, they will check the floors to sec if they 
have been tampered with. 

Heaps of rubble, waste, wood or coal piles in basements and 
yards will be probed. 


Closing Remarks 

If two enemies fight each other to the last—and this is always 
the case when an ideology is involved (religion is part of it) — 
guerrilla warfare and civilian resistance will inevitably break out in 
the final phase. 

The military expert who undervalues or even disregards guerrilla 
warfare makes a mistake since he does not take into consideration the 
strength of the heart. 

The last, and admittedly, most cruel battle will be fought by 
civilians. It will be conducted under the fear of deportation, of execu¬ 
tion, and concentration camps. 

We must and will win this battle since each Swiss male and 
female in particular believe in the innermost part of their hearts— 
even if they are too shy and sober in everyday life to admit or 
even to speak about it—in the old and yet very up-to-date saying: 

“Death rather than slavery!”
