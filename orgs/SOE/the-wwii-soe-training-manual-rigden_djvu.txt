Publisher's Note 


This publication reproduces the basic syllabus used at the Special Training 
Schools (STSs) of the Special Operations Executive. The version re¬ 
produced here - to our knowledge the most complete and comprehensive of 
the surviving SOE training materials - was used at STS 103 in Canada, 
better known as Camp X. The lecture folders containing the syllabus are to 
be found in two files, HS 7/55 and HS 7/56, which may be consulted at the 
National Archives, Kew. The aim has been to reproduce the words, layout 
and appearance of the original documents as faithfully as possible. 
However, to keep the extent of this edition within bounds, the lists of 
library books, films and supplementary reading material have been 
omitted. Also, where necessary, lines and lettering have been strength¬ 
ened in some of the illustrations; obvious typing errors have been 
corrected; and cross-references have been revised to conform to the pagi¬ 
nation of this edition. The Introduction and Index are modem additions. 

The National Archives is grateful to the Imperial War Museum for 
permission to reproduce the pictures from their photograph archive that 
appear on pages 3, 5,15 and 23 and on the back of the jacket; and to Lynn-

Introduction 


‘When you are fighting for your life against a ruthless opponent you cannot be 
governed by Queensberry rules. This government [Neville Chamberlain’s] would 
rather lose the war under Queensberry rules than do anything unbecoming to an 
absolutely perfect gentleman. That kind of thing will not do.’ 

Commander R.T. Bower, MP for Cleveland, 8 May 1940, 
two days before Winston Churchill became Prime Minister 

Men and women training to serve during World War II in the Special Operations 
Executive (SOE) were quickly made to forget all thoughts about Queensberry rules 
and so-called ‘gentlemanly’ warfare. Many of these carefully selected trainees (or 
students, as SOE officers called them) were taught a vast range of sabotage 
techniques and bizarre methods of killing, some using knives, guns and ‘booby- 
trap’ devices made by SOE’s own talented teams of scientists and technicians. 
Some of these students also learned about waging war through disseminating 
black propaganda that would sap the enemy’s will to fight. All the SOE agents 
serving in the field, in their clandestine struggle against Nazi Germany or Japan’s 
militarist regime, were also thoroughly trained in how best to advise, arm and 
otherwise aid members of the Resistance movements in the enemy-occupied 
countries. In giving such advice the agents needed to be skilled negotiators, able to

and otherwise aid Resistance movements in various parts of the world. (TNA: PRO, HS 5/121)

persuade guerrilla groups when to strike and when to hold back. When Resistance 
fighters undertook operations independently, it usually achieved little or nothing 
of military value and often resulted in the enemy taking savage revenge on the 
local civilian population. Trained to be aware of the dangers of rash guerrilla 
action, SOE agents strove to ensure that all irregular warfare served the strategic 
aims of the Allied leaders. 

The Special Operations Executive was created in July 1940,' in the deepest 
secrecy, from the fusion of three other unpublicized organizations: Section D of the 
Secret Intelligence Service (SIS or MI6); a branch of the Foreign Office known as 
EH or CS; and a research group in the War Office initially called GS(R), later 
MI(R), 2 these initials standing for General Staff (Research) and Military 
Intelligence (Research) respectively. All these small and poorly funded ‘parents’ of 
SOE had existed only since shortly before the war. Section D - some commentators 
say that the D stood for ‘Destruction’, while others believe it was an arbitrarily 
chosen initial - had begun devising various schemes for sabotage and subversion in 
Europe in the event of hostilities against Hitler’s Germany. EH had studied how 
anti-Nazi propaganda campaigns might be conducted, and MI(R) had begun a 
broad study of irregular warfare (an assignment overlapping that of Section D). 


The four-stage Training Plan 

SOE, from its headquarters at 64 Baker Street, 3 in London, quickly built up a large 
network of‘Top Secret’ establishments called Special Training Schools (STSs). It 
inherited only two such facilities from two of its ‘parent’ bodies: from MI(R) a group 
of large houses in remote countryside in the Arisaig area of Inverness-shire in the 
Western Highlands of Scotland, and from Section D a school of sabotage and 
clandestine warfare at Brickendonbury Manor in Hertfordshire. 

Shortly after Major F.T. (Tommy’) Davies 4 of MI(R) joined SOE in the autumn of 
1940, he devised a four-stage Training Plan. It was adopted by the SOE leadership 
immediately and its broad outlines were never altered, although there were 
important changes in detail, including the introduction of much highly specialized 
training. The plan envisaged Preliminary Schools, Paramilitary Schools and 
Finishing Schools, and the provision of a fiat in London where agents could be 
given a final briefing before being sent into the field. 

In the Preliminary Schools the students’ character and potential for dangerous 
clandestine work were assessed without revealing to them much about what SOE 
did. To house these schools, in the winter of 1940-1 SOE obtained six big houses in 
the Home Counties, to which was added the Free French School at Inchmery 
House, Beaulieu, in Hampshire. 5 It was the piecemeal requisition of these and 
other large residences, some of them luxurious, that provoked students to make 
waggish remarks about the ‘Stately ’Omes of England’. 

The Preliminary Schools syllabus covered physical training, weapons handling, 
unarmed combat, elementary demolitions (with no mention of what was in the SOE 
stores), map reading, fieldcraft and basic signalling. Much of this was the sort of 
training that any army recruit might expect to receive.

However, the Preliminary Schools did have special security problems. As 
explained by Professor W.J.M. Mackenzie/ SOE’s official war historian from 1945 
to 1948, these schools: 

. . . continued to be the main points of entry into the service of SOE 
until the summer of 1943, but they proved to have some 
disadvantages in practice. It was not very easy to invent effective 
courses which gave away no secrets: the students sent to them by 
Country Sections [the geographical departments at SOE 
headquarters] were not always well selected, yet it was difficult to 
convince a Country Section of their mistakes at so early a stage of 
training: Country Sections in a hurry were apt to complain of the 
delay of three or four weeks which the preliminary course involved, 
and to try to push their men straight on to a later stage of training. 

SOE’s experience (like that of other services) was that much effort 
was wasted on students who were eventually rejected at a late stage 
of training - or (worse still) were passed as fit in the hope of avoiding 
this waste: and it suffered the additional disadvantage that students 
rejected late in their training knew too much and could not be 
returned at once to the outer world. 









4 SOE SYLLABUS 


In an attempt to solve this security problem, SOE opened what were officially 
named the ‘ISRB Workshops’ 7 at Inverlair, Inverness-shire - though informally, 
and more accurately, they were referred to as ‘the Cooler’. It was there that 
incompetent or unlucky agents were held until their knowledge of secrets could no 
longer endanger operations or otherwise damage the war effort. Putting an agent 
or student in ‘the Cooler’ did not mean that he was regarded as a potential traitor; 
and, indeed, no criticism of his character was intended. He was kept isolated from 
the outside world for as short a time as was judged necessary. 

Belatedly - in June 1943 - SOE introduced a much quicker and generally better 
system of selecting students. In place of the Preliminary Schools, it set up a 
Students Assessment Board (SAB). In a country house called Winterfold (STS 7, 
formerly STS 4) at Cranleigh, in Surrey, the SAB gave the candidates a wide 
variety of psychological and practical tests over a four-day period. This was in stark 
contrast to the Preliminary Schools course lasting up to four weeks and justifiably 
criticized as ‘leisurely’. The SAB’s examining team consisted of six military testing 
staff (three captains and three sergeants) and four Royal Army Medical Corps 
officers, comprising two psychiatrists (majors) and two psychologists (a captain and 
a lieutenant). After the testing, a final selection board - made up of the SAB 
president (the lieutenant-colonel commanding STS 7), the examiners, and 
representatives of the Country Sections - discussed the performance of each 
candidate thoroughly and suggested which of the men (and women at some 
sessions) should be chosen. However, the ultimate choice of students rested with 
the president. His decision could be overturned only by Brigadier E.E. Mockler- 
Ferryman, the SOE Council member whose duties included overseeing the training 
system. In exceptional circumstances, he was appealed to by Country Sections 
which had nominated candidates and then had them rejected at STS 7. 

There were a few modifications of the SAB’s selection system to meet particular 
needs, such as those of the Free French, the Poles and the three-member SOE-OSS 
Jedburgh teams which aided the French Resistance on and after D-Day. By the 
autumn of 1944, when the end of the war in Europe seemed to be in sight, SOE’s 
training programme was being greatly reduced. As a result, the Students 
Assessment Board was disbanded on 16 November 1944. Any later selection of 
agents was usually done by the Country Sections alone. 


The Paramilitary Schools 

The Paramilitary Schools, or Group A Schools, were opened between November 
1940 and June 1941. Numbered STS 21 to STS 25c, they were based in 10 shooting 
lodges in the Arisaig and Morar areas of Inverness-shire. The surrounding 
countryside, which includes Loch Morar and Loch Nevis, is rugged and remote, 
ideal for the commando-style training that was provided. One of the schools, STS 
23b, based at Swordland, Tarbet Bay and Morar, began giving various para-naval 
instruction but eventually concentrated mainly on teaching how to use special 
devices when attacking ships. STS 22a, at Glasnacardoch Lodge, Mallaig, was a 
foreign-weapons school. The only instruction not given in Inverness-shire was

parachute training. It was provided at Ringway airfield, Manchester. The SOE 
students jumped alongside other trainees but they lodged in isolation from them in 
two secure houses (STSs 51a and 51b) near the airfield. At any one time the 
parachute school (STS 51) gave at least five days’ training to 70 SOE students, but 
many had their training stopped without warning and were sent to London for 
operational briefing after only two or three days at Ringway. 

The Arisaig and Morar group of schools could accommodate up to 75 students. 
Courses at first lasted three weeks but were gradually increased to five. The main 
subjects on the syllabus, details of which were changed often, included physical 
training, silent killing, weapons handling, demolition, map reading and compass 
work, fieldcraft, elementary morse, and raid tactics. 

By the autumn of 1944 the Allies were well on the way towards liberating 
Europe from Nazi tyranny, and it was clear that there was no longer a need to train 
large numbers of agents in paramilitary warfare. It was therefore decided to close 
the Arisaig and Morar group of Special Training Schools. The last of the students 
left on 1 December 1944. 


The Finishing Schools 

It was not until students arrived at the Finishing Schools (also called the Beaulieu 
Area and Group B Schools) that they were told what SOE did and that they were in

training to serve with SOE. In the Preliminary Schools most students probably 
guessed that they were being groomed for unspecified special duties; in the 
Paramilitary Schools it became obvious that that was so, but the instructors never 
admitted the true purpose of the training. Many students did, however, deduce 
something near the truth or had been told at least a little about SOE’s clandestine 
work by the Country Section officers who had recruited them. 

The Finishing Schools were grouped around the Hampshire village of Beaulieu, 
best known today as the home of the National Motor Museum. There were 
eventually 11 of them (STSs 31 to 37b), opened between January 1941 and October 
1942. The syllabus was divided into five sections, each with its own department 
and instructors. Department A, the principal one, taught ‘questions of agent 
technique, clandestine life, personal security, clandestine organization and 
methods of communication, and the recruitment and handling of agents’ - that is, 
the sub-agents controlled by the STS-trained agents. Subjects covered in detail 
included how agents should maintain their cover, how they should act when under 
police surveillance, and how, if arrested, they should handle the usually terrifying 
ordeal of interrogation. Department B conducted exercises related to the matters 
taught by Department A. Some of the exercises were held in local towns; for 
example, students simulated brief secret meetings with Resistance-movement 
contacts outside a church and inside a public library in Boscombe. Other exercises 
concerned what were euphemistically called ‘specialist subjects’, including 
burglary and the picking of locks and handcuffs. Department C dealt with the 
organization of enemy forces, overt and covert. Instruction focused mainly on 
German ones, such as the Wehrmacht, Abwehr, SD and Gestapo, but with much 
information also given on Japanese, Italian and Vichy French organizations. 
Department D handled the clandestine dissemination of propaganda, described as 
‘morale warfare’. Lectures covered both white and black propaganda. The white 
came from ‘authentic sources’, such as Allied governments or Resistance 
movements. It included BBC broadcasts and leaflets dropped by the RAF or 
distributed by the Resistance. The black propaganda ostensibly came from an 
enemy source, perhaps a military headquarters or a government department, but 
in reality was written or broadcast by Allied secret organizations, mainly by 
Britain’s Political Warfare Executive (PWE) and the Morale Operations (MO) 
branch of the US Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Examples of black propaganda 
included forged military orders and the regular output of PWE’s Soldatensender 
Calais, purportedly a German-army radio station transmitting from the French 
port. Department E taught the use of codes, ciphers and secret inks. 

The subject matter of the lectures given in these departments was constantly 
kept up to date by including information from intelligence reports, the enemy press 
and radio, and Country Sections. Shortly after agents returned from operations, 
they visited the Finishing Schools and gave detailed accounts of their experiences. 

Other STSs associated with the final stages of training included the Holding 
Schools, the Country Section Schools and the Specialist Schools. Eventually there 
were seven Holding Schools - six in country houses and one in a castle" - scattered 
around the Midlands and southern England. Trained students were accommodated 
in them in comfortable isolation while waiting, for varying lengths of time, to be

sent on operations. The atmosphere in these "Stately ’Omes’ was often tense. That 
was understandable, as the students were keyed up after their exacting training 
programmes and were eager to see action. Little or no revisionary tuition was 
provided in some of these schools, so many of these talented and patriotic young 
men and women were just allowed to stagnate. Another problem was that some of 
the Country Sections disliked the Holding Schools, believing that it would be less 
costly and more convenient to accommodate the students in safe houses in London 
rather than in distant and unpopular STSs. The Danish, Norwegian, Polish and 
Czech Country Sections exercised a considerable amount of control over the 
training of the students whom they had chosen as potential agents. These four 
sections had their own Country Section Schools running versions of the SOE 
syllabus modified to suit the requirements of these nationalities. 


The Specialist Schools 

SOE needed many sorts of specialists, and had various schools to train them. The 
most important of these schools was STS 17 at Brickendonbury Manor. It was both 
a research centre and a school, teaching industrial sabotage, ‘counter-scorching’ 
(the prevention of demolitions by retreating enemy forces) and the making in 
operational conditions of home-made explosive devices. Targets that students 
learned how to attack included factory machinery, railway lines and trains, dock 
installations, commercial shipping, telecommunications, grounded aircraft, 
berthed submarines and other naval ships, and, indeed, almost anything 
mechanical that benefited the enemy’s war effort. 

From October 1941 until its closure in June 1945, STS 17 was commanded by 
Lieutenant-Colonel George T. Rheam. He was an inspired inventor of sabotage 
techniques and a fine teacher. A rather forbidding figure, tall and at times dour, he 
was nevertheless an encouraging leader. Keenly supportive of students from 
enemy-occupied countries, he admired the bravery and resourcefulness of members 
of Resistance movements, especially the Norwegians. The military historian 
Professor M.R.D. Foot" regards Rheam as ‘the founder of modern industrial 
sabotage’ and writes: 

Anyone trained by him could look at a factory with quite new eyes, 
spot the few essential machines in it, and understand how to stop 
them with a few well-placed ounces of explosive; to stop them, 
moreover, in such a way that some of them could not be restarted 
promptly by removing undamaged parts from comparable machines 
nearby. 

In 1943 and 1944, when STS 17 was working at full stretch, it often accommodated 
about 35 students in its cramped quarters. There was no segregation of 
nationalities, unlike in some other SOE schools. By employing interpreters, 
instruction was given in several languages in courses lasting up to four weeks. As 
well as theoretical work at Brickendonbury Manor, the students — many of whom 


INTRODUCTION 9 


had no industrial background — went on conducted visits to factories to familiarize 
themselves with the sorts of machinery that should be sabotaged. They also went 
on day and night exercises locally. 

Each of the Specialist Schools had a specific purpose. STS 37a trained a few 
students in advanced photography and micro-photography. STS 39 (or STP) 
instructed an even smaller number of officers selected to be specialists in 
subversive propaganda and in the assessment of public opinion in the Axis and 
occupied countries. Known as the Hackett School, after its commanding officer, 
Major J.W. Hackett, it gave more advanced courses than those in the Finishing 
Schools and mainly served PWE. 

STS 40 was opened in September 1943 following serious mistakes made by 
agents handling the recently introduced S-Phone and equipment code-named 
Rebecca/Eureka. To correct these errors, the school ran a concentrated 10-day 
course on the use and maintenance of these effective new aids to RAF dropping 
operations. (The S-Phone was a long-distance transmitter-receiver small enough to 
be strapped to an agent’s chest. Eureka was a land-based radar device that relayed 
information to a travelling set, Rebecca, in a ship or aircraft.) 

STS 47 gave advanced training on mines and the use of enemy weapons; and 
STS 52 provided security training for wireless operators. 

Various other sorts of specialist training were found to be useful from time to 
time. As a consequence, courses were held on handling carrier pigeons and on 
driving unfamiliar sorts of motor vehicles. Some students needed a special 
knowledge of street fighting. They received instruction in London, in Battersea,

10 SOE SYLLABUS 


and towards the end of 1944 SOE shared the use of a street-fighting practice area 
in Southampton. 

In June 1944 SOE began an altogether different sort of training - that of a 
group of German prisoners-of-war, code-named Bonzos, who hated the Nazis and 
were keen to fight on the Allied side. The selection of these men from the many 
thousands of PoWs held by the Allies was made by Section X, the Country Section 
responsible for operations in Germany and Austria. After an initial interrogation 
in London, the Bonzos were interrogated in depth at STS 2 (Bellasis, Box Hill 
Road, Dorking, Surrey), which had been converted into a PoW camp. Those judged 
to be potential agents were sent to other schools. Although segregated from other 
students, their syllabus was not greatly different. They were given those parts of 
the Group B and industrial sabotage (STS 17) training that were applicable to the 
sort of operations Section X thought they could undertake. Again isolated from 
other students, they received parachute training at Ringway airfield (STS 51). 
Some time after June 1944, the German Directorate - Section X’s name during the 
last months of the war in Europe - was given use of STS 5 (Wanborough Manor, 
Puttenham, Guildford, Surrey) as a Holding School for Bonzos who had returned 
from operations and were awaiting possible redeployment. Major G.M. Forty’s 
official History of the Training Section of SOE states that 51 of these former 
prisoners-of-war were trained; and, in Gubbins and SOE, Sir Peter Wilkinson and 
Joan Bright Astley mention that about 28 of them went on missions in the final

months of the war in Europe. The adventures of only a few of these men have been 
published. 10 Major Forty also records that there were seven ‘Periwig Bonzos’ - 
students who were trained at STS 19 (Gardener’s End, Ardeley, Stevenage, 
Hertfordshire) for a proposed Operation Periwig. (Planned jointly by SOE and 
PWE, this operation envisaged the creation in 1945 of an imaginary German 
underground movement which, it was hoped, would add to the confusion within the 
Nazi regime and the Wehrmacht during the last desperate days of the Third Reich. 
The quick advances of the Soviet and Western armies towards Berlin made Periwig 
redundant.) 


STS 103 (Camp X) 

There were a few Special Training Schools outside Britain. STS 101 was opened in 
Singapore by SOE’s ill-fated Oriental Mission in July 1941. Some of its trainees 
formed ‘stay-behind parties’ which harassed the occupying Japanese army from 
hide-outs deep in the Malayan jungle. STS (or ME) 102 was opened at Ramat 
David, near Haifa, in December 1941 and was moved to Italy after the Allies had 
gained a firm foothold there. This school trained agents for operations in the 
Balkans and the Middle East. After the Allied landings in North Africa, a group of 
STSs was set up by the Massingham Mission in Algiers to provide similar training 
in preparation for operations in southern France and Italy. These schools were also 
transferred to Italy after the Allies had established themselves there. Other STSs 
were run by SOE’s India Mission near Poona and by Special Operations Australia 
(SOA), a branch of SOE operating (under several cover-names) in Japanese- 
occupied countries. 

Probably the most important - and certainly the most interesting - of the 
overseas schools was STS 103 in Canada. Best known today as Camp X, it was the 
first secret-agent training establishment in North America. Opened on 9 December 
1941, two days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, it gave invaluable help 
to Colonel William J. ('Big Bill’ or ‘Wild Bill’) Donovan 11 in his setting up on 13 June 
1942 of the OSS, the forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). 

The idea of opening an STS in Canada was first discussed in the summer of 1941 
and a secluded former farmland site for it, near Oshawa in Ontario Province, was 
found in October. Initially the school was envisaged as having two functions: to 
train men recruited in Canada, such as French Canadians and refugees, for service 
with SOE in Europe, and to give Top Secret assistance to the United States’ 
nascent foreign intelligence service - something that could not be done on US 
territory while America remained neutral. However, with the US soon in the war, 
this second function became much more important. In the ensuing years STS 103 
trained large numbers of Americans for security and propaganda work in South 
America, and it helped both the OSS and another US organization, the Office of 
War Information (OWI), to set up their own schools and to train their own staff. 
Almost all OSS’s first instructors and many of its first senior executives attended 
courses at Camp X or, later, were influenced by those who had taught there. The

British aid and advice, especially ‘in regard to propaganda, intelligence and special 
operations’. 12 Also, William R. Corson wrote in The Armies of Ignorance , ‘The 
British provided the base from which the wartime OSS was able to apprentice its 
personnel.. .’ u 

For administrative purposes STS 103 was controlled by British Security Co¬ 
ordination (BSC), the mission in New York representing SIS’s and SOE’s interests 
in the western hemisphere; BSC was headed by William (Little Bill) Stephenson, 11 
a personal representative of Winston Churchill. The school’s non-teaching staff 
were provided by the Canadian army, but decisions on training policy and practice 
were taken by SOE’s Director of Training in Britain, who also appointed the 
commanding officer and the instructors. 

As STS 103’s whole syllabus was broader than that of other SOE schools, nearly 
all of it has been included in this book - or at least all that is likely to interest the 
reader. Among the omitted elements are details of the physical education courses 
and the titles of books and films in the library. American students and those 
participating in the setting up of the OSS and OWI schools were given the 
Finishing Schools (Group B) training, together with advanced instruction on 
propaganda. Students recruited in Canada for employment by SOE in enemy- 
occupied countries of Europe and Asia received only the paramilitary (Group A) 
training, the rest of the instruction being given in Britain. As well as being a 
unique school, Camp X housed a telecommunications complex, Military Research

Centre No. 2, which was the main channel of intelligence traffic between London, 
Washington and Ottawa. The Centre, code-named Hydra, remained in being after 
the school’s closure in April 1944. It was manned by Canadians, and shortly after 
the war it was made part of Canada’s contribution to a Western network 
monitoring Soviet communications. 

Unlike the Special Training Schools in England and Scotland, with their manor 
houses and shooting lodges, STS 103 did not use existing buildings. Instead, it 
occupied a purpose-built camp in an area chosen for its suitability. It was sited 
outside Whitby, a characterless little town near Oshawa on the northern shore of 
Lake Ontario. The STS was isolated because nobody visited Whitby unless they 
needed to do so, yet Toronto was an easy car ride from the school. The informal title 
‘Camp X’ requires explanation. Instructors and students occasionally called it that, 
but it was usually referred to as ‘the Camp’ or ‘the Farm’, having been built on 
fields once owned by a farmer. Hearing explosions, local inhabitants thought it was 
a demolitions testing area - as indeed it was, of a sort. It was only after the war 
that they, and the world at large, learned what the camp really did. 

STS 103 had three successive commanding officers: Lieutenant-Colonel Terence 
Roper-Caldbeck, Lieutenant-Colonel R.M. (Bill) Brooker and Lieutenant-Colonel 
Cuthbert Skilbeck. Of these, Brooker made the largest contribution to the school’s 
success. He was the first chief instructor, from day one, and then C.O. from August 
1942 to March 1943. He enthralled audiences of students with his anecdotes, jokes 
and vivid descriptions of life as a secret agent. At one lecture his delivery was so 









14 SOE SYLLABUS 


spellbinding that a visiting senior OSS officer seriously wondered whether he was 
head of SIS. In the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s Brooker travelled widely 
in Europe, mainly as a salesman. He had various adventures, including using false 
papers to smuggle blocked pesetas out of Spain during the Spanish Civil War. 
Shortly after enlisting at the start of the Second World War, he learned about 
interrogation techniques when working as a port security officer on Tyneside. This 
led to him being talent-spotted by the future executive head of SOE, Colin Gubbins, 
who at that time was the officer in charge of the organization’s training and 
operations policy. Gubbins appointed Brooker as an instructor at the Finishing 
Schools before sending him to Camp X as its chief instructor. Beaulieu and STS 103 
were ‘twins’, separated by the Atlantic Ocean but thinking alike. 

Brooker was a vigorous ‘salesman’ of SOE’s training methods, especially in his 
many discussions with Donovan and other leaders of the American intelligence 
community. ‘Wild Bill’, who was not always an easy man to negotiate with, valued 
Brooker’s advice and in a personal letter to him, on 27 December 1942, wrote: ‘I am 
convinced that our training program, due in large measure to your inspiration and 
guidance, has made rapid strides ... It is my hope that our association may 
continue not only for its already proven worth but for your aid in the problems of 
both war and peace which lie ahead.’ 15 In March 1943 Brooker returned to Beaulieu 
and shortly afterwards was sent to the joint SOE-OSS training school in Algiers. 

Roper-Caldbeck, a Harrow-educated Scot, joined SOE in August 1941. A regular 
army officer with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, he had served before the 
war with the Shanghai Defence Force and in West Africa. He had commanded two 
Special Training Schools in Britain before being appointed Camp X’s first 
commanding officer. 

Skilbeck began his wartime secret service as a consequence of answering an 
advertisement in The Times asking for people who spoke French and German. 
Commissioned as a second lieutenant in March 1940, he served as a field security 
officer in Marseilles for less than a year. He was then recalled to Britain and was 
recruited by SOE in March 1941. Skilbeck was a chief instructor at Beaulieu before 
joining STS 103 as its chief instructor in August 1942. He succeeded Brooker as 
commanding officer in March 1943. When STS 103 closed on 20 April 1944, 
Skilbeck completed his war service by working for the Canadian Government’s 
denazification programme as an interrogator among the many German prisoners- 
of-war held in Canada. 

Like the commanding officers, the instructors at STS 103 (and many other SOE 
schools) had interesting antecedents. Captain Hamish Pelham-Burn, another 
Harrow-educated Scot, was known as ‘the wild Highlander’. He taught a wide 
variety of paramilitary warfare techniques, but it was explosives that fascinated 
him. Always having an eye open for something to blow up, the frequent bangs he 
produced were heard miles away - reinforcing the local population’s belief that 
Camp X was a testing ground for demolitions. As an officer in the Seaforth 
Highlanders, Pelham-Burn had narrowly escaped being captured in France shortly 
before the evacuation from Dunkirk. Back in Britain, he joined the RAF, trained as 
a fighter pilot and flew Hurricanes until grounded because of a minor illness. In 
mid 1942 he transferred to SOE and was an instructor at Arisaig before being sent 


NTRODUCTION 15 


to STS 103. Highly imaginative and skilled, Pelham-Burn greatly increased the 
number and variety of fieldcraft exercises in and around the camp. Some of his 
innovations involved the use of three Tiger Moth biplanes provided by the Royal 
Canadian Air Force. Wearing maximum gear, students were taught by him how to 
leave and board these old planes as quickly and silently as possible - something 
that SOE agents would have to do when Lysander aircraft landed in occupied 
France. 

Major William Ewart Fairbairn was Camp X's expert on silent killing. A senior 
officer in the Shanghai police before the war, he had two nicknames: Fearless Dan 
and the Shanghai Buster. He and another SOE instructor. Major Eric Anthony 
Sykes (who had also served in the Shanghai police), were the inventors of the 
double-edged and razor-sharp Fairbairn-Sykes commando knife. Along with its 
OSS counterpart, it was the most efficient weapon for cutting a sentry’s throat on a 
dark night. The unconventional use of many sorts of weapons, not just knives, was 
Fairbairn’s special study. His knowledge of the martial arts of the East was 
unrivalled in the West. He was a dour man who in his leisure hours never read 
books or newspapers and seemed to have no intellectual interests. George 
Langelaan, an SOE agent who had been trained by Fairbairn in Scotland, said of 
him: ‘Off duty, his conversation was limited to two words: yes and no ... All his 
interest, all his knowledge, all his intelligence - and he was intelligent -

the Lysander was a multi-role aircraft mainly used in support of the army. A flight of specially 
equipped versions of the plane were employed on ‘special duties’. Operating from bases in 
England, they secretly landed in France to deliver and pick up SOE agents and members of the 
Resistance. (Reproduced by courtesy of the Imperial War Museum, HU 82545)

concentrated on one subject and one subject only - fighting.’ 16 Instruction on 
unarmed combat, a subject that overlapped with Fairbaim’s, was given by 
Sergeant-Major George de Rewelyskow. The son of an Olympic wrestling gold 
medallist of White Russian origin, he himself had been a professional wrestler 
before the war. 

In sharp contrast to Fairbaim and de Rewelyskow was Major Paul Dehn, the 
chief instructor in 1943—4. Bubbling with fun and wit in the mess, in the classroom 
he was a first-rate lecturer, being especially well informed on propaganda 
techniques. A poet, lyricist and musician, after the war he became a highly 
successful writer of film scripts, including those of Orders to Kill and The Spy who 
came in from the Cold. Following STS 103’s closure, Dehn continued working for 
SOE - initially in newly liberated France and Norway and finally by writing an 
agents’ training handbook based on the syllabus at Beaulieu and Camp X. 


How many students? 

The total number of men and women trained by the Special Operations Executive is 
unknown. Although there was a Training Section headquarters in London under a 
Director of Training, there was no centralized responsibility for the whole of SOE 
training. The organization’s surviving archives 17 contain no figures for the number of 
agents trained in the Mediterranean theatre of war. However, as Professor W.J.M. 
Mackenzie says in his history of SOE (in file CAB 102/652 at the National Archives), 
‘the output there was considerable, but (to judge from operational experience) a high 
proportion of the officers sent to the Balkans were by London standards virtually 
untrained’. In Britain, where the Training Section headquarters did exercise control, 
SOE provided around 13,500 courses for about 6,800 students, the overwhelming 
majority of whom were nationals of enemy-occupied countries. Only 480 of the 
students were British. Mackenzie’s history says: ‘Some 760 Americans of various 
origins were trained for OSS, as well as many nationals of other countries recruited by 
the Americans.’ There were about 50 SOE training establishments in Britain, the 
total increasing or decreasing according to operational needs. The number of 
instructors and other STS staff also varied, reaching a peak of about 1,200 to 1,400 
officers and other ranks. This was a large training force in relation to the total number 
of students; but if it had been significantly reduced, the SOE schools could not have 
turned out the flow of‘graduates’ needed in the European and Asian theatres of war. 

As well as training its own agents and providing the already mentioned 
assistance to the OSS and the OWI, SOE aided other organizations by running 
courses suited to their special needs or by giving advice. PWE agents were trained 
in advanced propaganda techniques at the Hackett School (STP/STS 39). Other 
STSs instructed them in weapons handling, radio operating in the field, 
parachuting and how to live the clandestine life. SOE also helped PWE select its 
personnel through loaning technical staff from the Students Assessment Board. 

All the parachute training required by SIS (MI6) was provided by SOE. Initially 
an average of six SIS students a week jumped at Ringway airfield (STS 51). That 
number was greatly increased in 1943 and early 1944 to train agents for SIS’s 


18 SOE SYLLABUS 


Sussex plan, the equivalent of the Jedburgh scheme. A total of 872 SIS students 
were trained in parachuting. From 1943 this instruction was also given to 
members of the SAS (the Special Air Service), 172 of whom were trained at STS 51. 
MI5 personnel attended STS courses on clandestine warfare and counter sabotage. 

In the autumn of 1944, SOE began helping France’s DOER (the Direction 
Generale des fitudes et Recherches) in its formation and running of a group of 
training schools called Centre 20. The French were given facilities to train 
instructors in England, and nine British instructors (five officers and four NCOs) 
worked at Centre 20 for various lengths of time until May 1945. The DGER 
reciprocated by providing much valuable intelligence and by enabling SOE to 
obtain specimens of enemy weapons, mines and special devices that had been 
difficult to get through other means. When the Special Allied Airborne Rescue 
Force (SAARF) 18 was formed early in 1945, SOE sent its members on the parachute 
course and gave other help with training. Various sorts of instruction were 
provided for individual officers and other ranks and for officials serving in the 
army, the Admiralty, the Foreign Office and other bodies. 

At its largest size, in the autumn of 1943, the headquarters of the Training 
Section comprised 12 officers, led by the Director of Training (a colonel). The others 
included a psychiatrist (an RAMC major) to advise on recruitment and similar 
personnel matters, an adviser on unarmed combat and weapons training (Major 
Sykes, the co-inventor of the Fairbairn-Sykes commando knife) and a liaison officer 
from the OSS (an American army major). 


Weapons, equipment and special devices 

The vast majority of weapons which SOE and OSS supplied to Resistance 
movements were identical to those used by the Allies’ conventional armed forces. The 
incompleteness of wartime records makes it impossible to make any worthwhile 
estimate of the total numbers of weapons sent to guerrilla groups worldwide. 
However, Ian Dear, 19 an authoritative military historian, has extracted some reliable 
figures from published sources. For example, his research reveals that SOE 
dispatched 25,000 small arms into the field in Burma, Malaya, French Indo-China 
and Thailand, as well as 1,300 Bren guns, PIATs 20 and mortars, 30 tons of explosives 
and 60,000 grenades. He adds that of the 418,083 weapons delivered to the 
Resistance in France, about 47 per cent were sub-machine guns, 30 per cent were 
rifles, 14 per cent were handguns, 5 per cent were light machine guns, 2 per cent 
were carbines and 1 per cent were anti-tank weapons. The rifles were mostly the 
standard British infantryman’s .303 Lee Enfield, while the British Bren and Sten 
guns were the most common automatic weapons - the Sten being popular with the 
Treasury because it was so inexpensive to manufacture. Most of the 57,849 handguns 
sent to France were the British Enfield and Webley service revolvers or the American 
Smith &amp; Wesson revolver. Captured enemy weapons were also often used. 

As well as these and other conventional weapons, SOE agents were supplied 
with an impressive assortment of arms, equipment and special devices needed in 
waging clandestine warfare. Much of all this was invented by SOE’s own talented 


INTRODUCTION 19 


scientists and technicians, led by the organization’s Director of Scientific Research, 
Dr Dudley Maurice Newitt, 21 a distinguished chemical engineer. Their Top Secret 
work began in earnest early in 1941 at Station IX (also called the Research 
Section), a requisitioned private hotel, The Frythe, in Welwyn Garden City, 
Hertfordshire. Apart from prototypes of sabotage devices and the results of some 
other important experimentation, the Station inherited little from SIS’s Section D. 

The rather cramped accommodation in The Frythe was the scene of four main lines 
of research: physical-chemical, engineering, operational and camouflage. The first two 
of these lines concerned problems related to fuses and the devices that would be 
detonated by them. These problems were largely solved through the invention of 
foolproof time fuses and incendiaries and through discovering better methods of using 
explosive charges. Chemical research moved into the sphere of biochemistry. The 
scientists investigated the use of poisons, sleeping draughts and suicide pills, and 
devised special rations suitable for eating during various operational conditions. 

The engineering line of research led to the invention of various devices, such as 
the magnetic ‘limpet’ bomb, and the design of special weapons, silenced or easily 
hidden. Other inventions included the Welman one-man submarine (the ‘Wei’ 
prefix referring to Welwyn), a larger version of it called the Welfreighter and the 
Sleeping Beauty motor submersible. All these craft were well designed and soon 
went into production. Unfortunately, however, they proved to be unsuitable for 
SOE’s purposes, at least in Europe. In Norway, for example, it was found to be 
easier and safer for agents to be equipped in other, simpler ways. As Professor 
Mackenzie remarks in his history of SOE, an agent’s ‘most important asset was 
skill, patience and local knowledge, not “suicide” weapons, however ingenious’. The 
trouble was that Station IX had surged ahead with the development of these craft 
without first receiving intelligence from any war zone to show that they could be 
used effectively. This, Mackenzie explained: 

is the central problem of organization for all research into weapons, 
and it was particularly difficult for SOE to solve it. It began its work 
. . . entirely without operational experience: and it was hard for it to 
capitalize experience as it was gained. Saboteurs are not usually good 
technical observers, nor can they take with them technical advisers, 
so that Operational Research was not possible for SOE in the same 
sense as for the other services. There was a serious danger that the 
user and the scientist would remain apart, and that research would 
be wasted on unreal problems. 

In July 1943 - much too late - an Operational Research Section was formed. But 
its position was not like that of a scientist attached to a night-fighter squadron 
armed with new radar equipment. Station IX boffins did not accompany saboteurs 
on operations. However, they were in dialogue with the Country Sections and, if 
possible, met their best agents. 

Camouflage had a special meaning in The Frythe. ‘Disguise’ would have been a 
more precise word to use in some contexts. The scientists, and SOE in general, 
recognized that an agent’s disguise must be perfect in every detail; and that less 


20 SOE SYLLABUS 


painstaking but nevertheless effective camouflage was needed to allow the quick 
concealment of weapons, ammunition and equipment. Initially the Country 
Sections organized the disguising of their own agents, and it was not until 
November 1941 that the first adviser on camouflage was appointed. He was a 
resourceful film technician, Mr (later Lieutenant-Colonel) J. Elder Wills. In 
January 1942 a camouflage workshop was opened. Its staff of three was gradually 
increased to about 300, including many skilled workers with specialist knowledge. 
In 1944, when its output was largest, the Camouflage Section (as the workshop had 
become) operated from four main sites. 

The Thatched Barn (Station XV), a road-house on the Barnet by-pass, north of 
London, was the Section’s headquarters and the principal production centre for the 
camouflage of stores. 

A London house, 56 Queen’s Gate, Kensington (Station XVa), was the site where 
prototypes of clothing and other items were designed in preparation for 
manufacture elsewhere. It was also the main place where an agent’s clothing was 



The Explosives Compound at the Thatched Barn (Station XV), where all manner of deadly 
devices were invented, customized and camouflaged in order to meet SOE agents’ needs.

‘aged’ to help make his or her cover story seem true. Care had to be taken to ensure 
that the tailoring of clothes gave no hint of their British origin. Initially enough 
genuine clothing was obtained from refugees, but eventually this source dried up 
and large-scale production had to be undertaken. This was done mainly bv 
companies employing refugees who made clothes in their own national styles 
without being told why they were doing so. 

SOE’s Demonstration Room was housed in the Natural History Museum, South 
Kensington (Station XVb). It was here that government ministers and other 
invited VIPs, including King George VI, inspected examples of the arms, 
equipment and bizarre gadgetry used by agents. As SOE was not short of critics in 
high places, the Demonstration Room - actually six rooms - was regarded as a 
means of winning friends and influencing people. Agents were also allowed to visit 
the Room, but few did so. The Natural History Museum, like many other of 
London’s attractions, was closed to the public during the war. 

The Camouflage Section’s photographic and make-up department (Station XVc) 
occupied small premises in South Kensington, at 2-3 Trevor Square. Among other 
services, it created photos for fake identity documents - some 1,620 agents being 
photographed between 1 March 1943 and 15 November 1944. The forgeries 
themselves were produced at Briggens, near Royden, Essex (Station XIV). 

By June 1944, the Camouflage Section was equipping as many as 16 agents 
every day. As well as running Stations XV to XVc, the section had by then 
established branches in Italy, Algeria, Egypt, India and Australia. Finally, in 
January 1945, it set up a branch in Brussels (liberated the previous September) to 
equip agents being infiltrated into Germany. 

SOE had its own storage and repair depots - two in Welwyn and one in Camberley, 
Surrey - and made only a small minority of its specialized materiel in its own 
workshops. The bulk of what it needed it obtained, using cover-names, by placing 
orders through the War Office, the Admiralty or the Air Ministry. All this was fairly 
easily organized, but it took a little time to devise an efficient method of packing 
containers and packages for dispatch to agents in the field. At first, each package was 
made up individually (usually by officers of the Country Section concerned) and the 
parachutes were packed and attached at the RAF depot at Henlow. This took too long 
and, for security reasons, involved the SOE men working behind a screen at one end of 
a large parachute repair workshop, out of sight of RAF personnel. In May 1942, 
however, that clumsy way of working was abandoned and the Special Parachute 
Equipment Section was formed with a staff of 30, mainly members of the Women’s 
Auxiliary Air Force. From May 1942 to January 1945 this section, working in 
isolation, handled 19,863 packages, made 10,900 parachute harnesses and packed 
27,980 parachutes, as well as doing much repair work. The section also became a 
centre of research into the use of parachutes in special operations, 

Henlow dealt with the mechanics of parachute drops. The contents of the 
packages were handled mainly by SOE’s own packing unit, Station 61, based 
initially at Audley End, Saffron Walden, and from April 1942 at Gaynes’ Hall, St 
Neots. A big increase in parachute operations began in the summer of 1942 when a 
‘standard container’ was introduced. Station 61 built up a bank of ready-packed 
containers. It packed 95 containers in 1941, 2,176 in 1942, 13,435 in 1943, 56,464 


22 SOE SYLLABUS 


in 1944 and 4,334 in 1945 - a total of 76,504, weighing about 10,000 tons. The 
largest number of containers packed in one day (6 July 1944) was 1,160. At 
maximum strength, Station 61 had about 150 personnel, supplemented by 96 
soldiers and 100 RAF men. Despite SOE’s need to work secretly at all times, 
outside help was requested (through an intermediary) in November 1943. As a 
result, a Kidderminster carpet company packed about 18,500 containers. The 
Americans also made a big contribution, with a packing station employing more 
than 250 workers. In addition, large numbers of containers were packed in North 
Africa to support operations in the Balkans, southern France and Italy. 


The 'shopping' catalogue 

SOE issued an illustrated catalogue of the ‘Special Devices and Supplies’ available 
for use by agents. This Top Secret internally circulated publication was like a pre¬ 
war mail-order catalogue from which shoppers could order goods. However, the 
‘shoppers’ whom the SOE catalogue was targeting were the organization’s own 
Country Sections and its regional headquarters worldwide. When requesting a 
particular weapon or piece of equipment or special device, a ‘shopper’ quoted the 
relevant code-number in the catalogue. For example, a Country Section wanting 
a ‘Parachutist, Watersuit, Mk. Y would ask for ‘N 265’; and SOE’s Cairo office 
needing ‘Inks, Secret’ would quote ‘HS 69’. The ‘shopping orders’ would be sent to 
‘MOl(SP), the War Office’ - a non-existent War Office branch, which was one the 
cover-names used by SOE headquarters. 

The 1944 and 1945 editions of the catalogue listed hundreds of different sorts of 
military items stored by SOE, all of them having been specially produced by or for the 
organization. As Mark Seaman says: 

By the end of the Second World War the Special Operations 
Executive had taken research and development of weapons and 
equipment to previously undreamed of levels. Material could be 
ordered from stock with the same ease as selecting a new suit or a 
pair of shoes from a mail-order catalogue ... 22 

The 1944 edition of the catalogue contained descriptions, methods of use and other 
essential information about incendiaries, flares, fuses, grenades, limpet devices, time 
pencils, tyre-bursters, trip wires, percussion caps and much else related to causing 
explosions. Also listed were ordinary tools adapted for agents’ use, such as wire- 
cutters, knives and jemmies. ‘Sundries’ included bags, balloons, luminous discs. 
Plasticine, magnets, adhesives, Alpine rope, rope ladders, nitrated paper, torches, 
and splinterproof windows that agents could build into their observation posts. 

There were also various unconventional guns and related devices and 
equipment, such as Polish and French ‘rail charges’ for wrecking trains, ‘guerrilla 
haversacks’, quick-release shoulder packs and ‘sleeve guns’. The catalogue entry 
for the sleeve gun described it as ‘a short length, silent murder weapon ... designed 
for carriage in the sleeve with the trigger near the muzzle to aid unobtrusive firing

when the gun is slid from the sleeve into the hand. The gun is intended for use in 
contact with the target, but may be used at ranges up to about three yards . . 

The underwater equipment included amphibian breathing apparatus, ‘deep¬ 
water, quick-opening’ steel containers, buoys, grapnels and several sorts of tackle. 
Among the medical items and food available to agents were a small ‘bandage kit’, a 
‘compact medical and first-aid kit suitable for units of 10 men and upwards’, 
surgical gloves and ‘rations European’. These included biscuits, chocolate, dried 
fruit, dehydrated beef, sage and mutton and ‘margarine, one man-day’. Also listed 
were tablets for air and sea sickness and water purifying. Sometimes agents also 
carried lethal ‘L tablets’, as the SOE leadership in London was fully aware that 
there was a limit to the heroism of even the bravest and most selfless men and 
women. The staff officers in Baker Street had no illusions about the extreme 
brutality practised routinely by Gestapo interrogators and acknowledged that in 
an extreme situation it would be better for an agent to commit suicide rather than 
reveal anything that might wreck operations and jeopardize the lives of hundreds 
or even thousands of people. L tablets were also occasionally seen as having an 
operational use. For example, at the request of the exiled Norwegian military 
leaders, SOE sent four agents to Norway in October 1942 solely to assassinate two 
of their compatriots who had a terrible record of collaboration with the enemy. The 
agents were equipped with eight L tablets, 15 bottles of poison, morphia syringes 
and ether pads, as well as ordinary weapons. 23 




24 SOE SYLLABUS 


One of the most frequently ordered items on the ‘shopping list’ was a fine 
Carborundum powder. When mixed with lubricating oil, it could cause almost any 
moving mechanical component to seize up. The powder was a particularly effective 
means of wrecking railway rolling stock. Without raising the suspicion of security 
staff, axles could be ‘lubricated’. Later, when the train was travelling at full speed, 
its wheels would jam and the train would crash. Often it was railwaymen who 
engaged in this sabotage. But on one occasion, in June 1944, it was two French 
teenage sisters who did so, thereby helping to seriously delay the transport by rail 
of tanks urgently needed by the German forces in Normandy. 

A few agents asked for itching powder and it was sent to them, sometimes through 
Switzerland, in tins marked Toot powder’. Made from tiny seed hairs, the powder 
caused extreme irritation if applied to the skin. Laundrywomen and domestic workers 
serving the German armed forces in occupied countries occasionally managed to 
smuggle the powder into U-boat bases and army camps and spread it lightly on the 
men’s bedding and underclothes. Occasionally, too, contraceptives were dusted with 
the powder and taken into brothels visited by German troops. In Norway, Resistance 
members reported that hospitals in the Trondheim area often had to treat soldiers 
incapacitated by unaccountable pain in sensitive parts of the body. 

Agents could also be provided with tubes of a creamy substance used to frost 
vehicle windscreens and other large areas of glass. The tubes bore the name and 
logo of a brand of suntan lotion popular in Germany before the war. Among other 
bizarre items in the SOE stores were incendiary cigarettes, briefcases and 
suitcases; and daggers small enough to be hidden in the palm of the hand. 

Much of the 1945 edition of the catalogue of ‘Special Devices and Supplies’ 
related to the long-distance transport of military stores by using what SOE 
scientists called ‘shells’ and ‘double shells’. Explosives, arms, ammunition, 
miniature radio equipment, money and food were hidden in cavities inside ‘shells’ - 
everyday objects, either real ones or imitations made of plaster or papier-mache. 
‘Double shell’ camouflage involved hiding military stores within tins, cartons or 
other containers of what masqueraded as being branded commercial goods. The 
concealed items were packed firmly so that they would not rattle if the containers 
were lifted or shaken; and the ‘double shells’ bore accurate reproductions of the 
labelling of the merchandise concerned. Also, other precautions were taken to 
minimize the chances of the military stores being discovered. For example, in 
preparation for smuggling a consignment of grenades into Norway, each grenade 
was greased and then sealed in a tin along with a little water. This was done so 
that any inspecting enemy official who shook the tin would accept it as being an 
ordinary import - as described on the label. 

Articles small enough to be carried in personal luggage or on the person - such as 
codes, messages and microscopic photographs - were concealed in fountain pens, 
pencils, wallets, bath salts, shaving sticks, toothpaste, talcum powder, lipsticks, 
manicure sets, sponges, penknives, shoe heels and soles, shoulder padding, collar 
studs, coat buttons and cigarette lighters. Agents carried their radio receiving and 
transmitting sets from place to place by hiding them in bundles of firewood. They 
also concealed them in adding machines, record players, vacuum cleaners and even 
in domestic radio sets. Miniature communication receivers were hidden in clocks and

other household goods, as well as in a German Bible. Few things were sacred in war. 

The 1945 edition of SOE’s catalogue ‘advertised’ anti-personnel explosive 
devices that were concealed in cavities inside actual everyday objects or in life-size 
models of them, usually made of plaster or celluloid. Some of these booby traps 
were designed solely for the war in the Far East. They included rusty nuts and 
bolts, lumps of coal, logs, railway fishplates, oilcans, Chianti bottles, clogs, life 
belts, bicycle pumps, food tins, soap, shaving brushes, books, Chinese stone 
lanterns, Balinese carvings, Japanese sauce tins, and rats. 

The rats — which, 50 years later, received widespread press coverage when SOE 
papers mentioning them were released by the PRO - comprised only the skins of the 
animals. Each of these was filled with plastic explosive and a time-pencil fuse. The 
rat device was developed early in 1941, and a man from Tottenham was inveigled 
into collecting the rodents, ostensibly for scientific research at London University. 
SOE’s F Country Section intended that the devices be planted by agents near 
boilers, believing that the boilermen would throw the rats into the fire and cause 
huge explosions. Although the Germans discovered the first consignment of the 
devices sent to France, the operation was successful in an unexpected way - as the 
occupation authorities wasted much time searching for ‘hundreds of rats’, which 
were supposed to have been distributed around the Continent-. 24

BALINESE CARVINGS. 

These are faithful reproductions of the famous Balinese wood carvings, but in 
this case they have been cast in solid H.E. and coloured to represent wood, sandstone 
or porcelain. Each head is mounted on a wooden base and equipped for initiation by 
a time delay. It is intended to use these through native posing as hawkers 
frequenting the quaysides, and selling them to Japanese troops about to embark.

How SOE was organized 

The Special Operations Executive was controlled by the Minister of Economic 
Warfare - Hugh Dalton until February 1942 and the third Earl of Selborne for the 
rest of the war. Dr Dalton, a Labour Party intellectual, is best remembered as the 
Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1945 to 1947. He was made a life peer in 1960. 
Lord Selborne, a Conservative, held junior government posts in the 1920s and was 
an important figure in the cement industry. The small government department 
that these two men successively headed was jokingly referred to as the ‘Ministry of 
Ungentlemanly Warfare’. 

In an undated memorandum, 25 probably written towards the end of 1943, 
Selborne explained the command structure in which SOE operated. According to a 
summary of that document, on matters relating to SOE the Minister of Economic 
Warfare reported direct to the War Cabinet; SOE received directives from the 
British Chiefs of Staff concerning strategic objectives on which it should 
concentrate and on the countries to which priority should be given; and SOE 
received guidance from the Foreign Office on objectives for underground political 
activity. SOE’s ultimate controllers were, of course, the US and British political 
and military leaderships. The implementation of grand strategy was the 
responsibility of the Combined Chiefs of Staff Committee based in Washington, 





INTRODUCTION 27 


which comprised the US Joint Chiefs of Staff and the British Chiefs of Staff. 
Towards the end of the war the Supreme Allied Commanders in the European and 
Asian theatres of conflict exercised some direct control of SOE, OSS and other 
organizations engaged in irregular warfare. For example, SOE received directives 
from SHAEF. General Eisenhower, Supreme Commander, Allied Expeditionary 
Force, was advised on special operations by an SOE officer, Brigadier Robin 
Brook. 26 

SOE had three Chiefs (executive heads). First, Sir Frank Nelson; then Sir 
Charles Hambro, from May 1942 to September 1943; and finally, Major-General 
Colin Gubbins for the remainder of the war. As a young man Nelson was a partner 
in an important Bombay trading company. During the First World War he served 
in military intelligence. A Conservative MP from 1924 to 1931, he was British 
Consul in Basle in 1939 and early 1940, learning much about Nazi German 
clandestine activity in and through Switzerland. Awarded the Military Cross in the 
First World War, Hambro was a merchant banker and Chairman of the Great 
Western Railway. Gubbins, another holder of a First World War MC, took part in a 
British military mission to Poland in the summer of 1939. In 1940 he led the 
Independent Companies (forerunners of the Commandos), which harassed the 
lines of communication of the invading German army in Norway, and, back in 
London, he began organizing Auxiliary Units, small guerrilla groups that would 
have been mobilized if Britain had been invaded. Joining SOE in November 1940, 
Gubbins - already the author of pamphlets on irregular warfare - was initially in 
charge of training and operations policy. He was Vice-Chief before being appointed 
Chief. A wiry Scots Highlander, he was skilled both as a linguist and negotiator 
with all sorts of Allied military and political leaders. He was SOE’s greatest 
guiding force. After the war he was awarded the KCMG and similar honours from 
the US, France, Poland, Norway, Denmark, Holland, Belgium and Greece. 

SOE’s agents were drawn from all social and professional backgrounds. They 
belonged to any non-Nazi and non-Fascist political party or to none. They were of 
any religion or none. They might be of any age, as shown by the two teenage French 
sisters sabotaging railway rolling stock. Even hardened criminals, especially those 
with useful skills such as burglary and safe-breaking, were not excluded. As 
Professor Mackenzie notes in his history, ‘it is extremely difficult to say where SOE 
begins and where it ends’. He adds: 

As regards agents in the field, there is a series of delicate gradations. 

At one extreme are British officers and men, trained, paid and 
dispatched by SOE. Then there are members of the foreign forces in 
Great Britain or the Middle East, also sponsored wholly by SOE but 
dividing their loyalty between it and their own government. There 
are also agents recruited in the field by these ‘men from England’; 
paid and directed by them but never themselves in direct contact 
with SOE. Finally there is the whole mass of resistance workers who 
took some money, or some arms, or some guidance from SOE, but 
were not in any sense at all its servants. 


28 SOE SYLLABUS 


From all this, it is clear that any estimate of the total number of SOE agents would 
only be a foolish guess. 


Conclusion 

What did SOE achieve? It failed to ‘set Europe ablaze’, as Churchill tasked it to do, 
but it made a huge contribution to the war effort. If SOE had done nothing else, its 
Operation Gunnerside - the destruction of the heavy-water plant in the Norsk 
Hydro complex in Vemork, Norway — would have justified its existence. If 
Gunnerside had failed or never been attempted, Hitler would have continued with 
his atomic weapons research programme. SOE’s other greatest achievement was 
its contribution to the liberation of France. The maquis’ sabotage of bridges, 
railways and other major installations seriously delayed German army 
reinforcements reaching Normandy in June 1944. European Resistance 
movements, the recipients of massive aid from SOE and OSS, were regarded by 
General Eisenhower as a strategic weapon. In his opinion the disparate bodies 
comprising the French Resistance ‘shortened the war [in Europe] by nine months’. 27

Notes 

1 SOE was given its charter on 19 July 1940. and its formation was approved by the War 
Cabinet three days later. 

2 MI(R) was formally disbanded on 2 October 1940. 

3 Although 64 Baker Street was SOE’s main headquarters office, the headquarters had 
other premises locally, too. 

4 Davies became SOE’s Director of Research, Development and Supply with the rank of 
colonel.

17 An estimated 85 to 87 per cent of SOE’s archives now no longer exist. Many documents 
were consumed in a fire at the organization’s London headquarters shortly after the war 
(the fire started in a stationery store as a result of an accident). Some of the records held 
at SOE’s Cairo office were destroyed deliberately when it seemed that the advancing 
German army was unstoppable. Yet other SOE papers were lost as a direct or indirect 
consequence of enemy action in the various theatres of war, or because wartime record¬ 
keeping was sometimes chaotic. 

18 The decision to form SAARF (called the Special Allied Airborne Reconnaissance Force in 
the Mackenzie history) was made on 17 March 1945. SAARF’s mercifully never-needed 
function was to protect Allied prisoners-of-war and displaced persons from being 
massacred by die-hard Nazis during the expected chaos when the Third Reich collapsed. 
In the event of such a bloodbath, or threat of it, 120 teams of SAARF personnel, organized 
on the Jedburgh pattern, would have had to arrive on the scene as quickly as possible.

CAMP ARRANGEMENTS 

NAME _ 

COURSE NO- _ ROOM NUMBER 


1. DRESS . 

On arrival in Camp you will be issued with Battle Dress (or Summer 
Drill) and the necessary accessories. This uniform will be worn 
during all working periods, for the following reasons: 

a) Security . This is a military establishment. For the benefit of 
local inhabitants and visiting tradesmen, it is considered 
advisable for the military appearance of the Camp to be 
consistently maintained. 

b) Wear and tear . Many of your activities on the course will be 
undertaken out of doors. By wearing your issued Battle Dress you 
will save your own civilian clothes and/or uniform. 

There is no objection to your wearing whatever clothes you please 
for relaxation in the evenings. 

You are not required to render military compliments to the 
officers of the Camp. 

2. COM MMI C &amp; TIONS. 

Any incoming mail may be addressed to you personally at: 

Box 55, 

Terminal A, 

Toronto 2, Ont., Canada. 

Any outgoing mail will be handed in at the Administration Office. In 
view of the fact that the Camp's location is secret, this will be 
mailed in Toronto. 

Therefore, NO mail will be handed to any member of the Camp 
Staff, other than the Clerks in the Administration Office who have 
been detailed to handle it. 

For the same reason outgoing mail, though uncensored, will 
not contain any reference either to the Camp's location, appearance 
or activities. 

Telephone calls from the Camp may be made outside working 
hours. NO incoming calls are permitted. 

3. MESSING . ANQ BAR SE RV I CE. 

a) Messina will be charged at the rate of .50 cents per day. A 
service charge of .50 cents per week will be made to cover 
gratuities to the staff. It is asked that no additional gratuities 
be made, as this rate is in accordance with Canadian Army scales. 

b) Bar . Within the limits of current rationing, beer, spirits and 
cigarettes are obtainable from the bar which will be open only 
between the following hours:

OBJECTS AND METHODS OF WARFARE 


1. OBJ E CT S 

In Europe and Asia the enemy seek to obtain from their own, from 
satellite and from occupied territories the maximum advantage: 

For example by: 

(i) indoctrination. 

(ii) "Divide and Rule". 

For example by: 

(i) Use of materials. 

(ii) Use of factories. 

(iii) Recruitment of foreign workers. 

(iv) Financial swindles. 

For example by: 

(i) Use of communications. 

(ii) Offensive and defensive bases. 

(iii) Use of Quisling &amp; satellite manpower. 

But spontaneous resistance has occurred everywhere: 

(a) Politically . E.g. Norway's battle of Churches and Teachers. 

(b) Economically . E.g. France's resistance to labour- 

recruitment . 

(c) Strategically . E.g. Mihailovic's guerrillas and abortive 

Haute Savoie rising. 

Sporadic rising are useless. Necessity to co-ordinate where 
possible has produced tabulation of United Nations' fundamental 
objectives in the waging of Irregular Warfare: 

(a) politically. 

(i) To undermine enemy's morale and that of his 
collaborators. 

(ii) To raise morale of Occupied Territories. 

(b) Economically. 

(i) To damage enemy's material. 

(ii) To improve and augment our own material. 

E.g. By infiltration of weapons, explosives, sabotage 
equipment. 


(a) Politically . 


(b) 


(c) st rategically . 













36 SOE SYLLABUS 


(c) Strategically . 

(i) To damage enemy's man-power and communications. 

(ii) To improve our own man-power and communications. 

E.g. By infiltration of "organizers", radio sets and 
operators, etc. 

2. METHODS 


These, by definition, include all methods of attaining the above 
objectives outside the scope of regular warfare. 

(a) Informational . 

- Espionage: The covert collection and transmission of 

information about the enemy to our own 
forces. 

(b) Operational . 

- Propaganda: The art of persuasion with a view to 

producing a required mood or a required 
action. 

- Passive Resistance: Infliction of the maximum damage to the 

enemy with the minimum danger to 
oneself. 

- Sabotage: Covert destruction of material 

profitable to the enemy. 

- Secret Armies: Pre- and Post-invasion. 

- Politico-Military uprising. 

3. INTERDEPENDENCE OF METHODS 

All these methods are interdependent. Each one singly has its 
relation to our fundamental objectives; but, if each is used 
singly, the objectives can never be attained. 

4. PRESENT SITUATION 
There are two phases: 

(a) Pre-Invasion . This phase, which in Europe is ending, 

consisted mainly in organzing the countries 
area by area - in a manner either simple or 
complex according to the country's physical 
geography, group-distribution and degree of 
contre-espionage control. 










SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 37 


(b) Invasion . This phase is beginning. For you it will involve 
the attainment of (a, b or c) objective by the 
use of (a, b, c, etc.) methods 

You will be a cog in a very large machine whose smooth 
functioning depends on each separate cog carrying out its part 
efficiently. 

It is the objective of this course to clarify the part you 
will play and ensure the efficiency of your performance.

INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE SECURITY 


1. DEFINITION . 

Security: "Precautions taken by the individual for his own 
personal protection and the protection of his Organization from 
the enemy". 

Without these precautions, it is dangerous to attempt regular and 
impossible to attempt irregular warfare alone or in conjunction 
with other people. 

2. APPLICATION. 

a) Apparent absence of enemy C.E. measures should never be 
allowed to engender over-confidence. (Cf. graph of agent's 
confidence.) 

b) Insecurity by an individual may jeopardise not only his own 
safety but the safety of the organization with which he is in 
contact. 

3. INFORMATION. 

Basis of your self-protection is good information. As much as 
possible provided before departure, but you must check and 
supplement on arrival. Information required on: 

i) Local Conditions, 

ii) Local Regulations, 

iii) Enemy methods, 

iv) Enemy personnel, 

v) Your own subordinates. 

4. INCULCATION . 

a) Security cannot be taught by rule of thumb. It is a frame of mind 
attainable through self-discipline and self-training that will 
make the taking of precautions a "habit". (Cf. crossing a road.) 

b) What is a habit? A single action committed so often as to 
become automatic. What precautionary actions must we practise 
so often that they become a habit? 

5. COMMUNICATION ■ 

The answer is "Communicatory Actions". Secret and confidential 
information can reach the enemy through our carelessness in: 

a) Speech. 

b) Writing. 








SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 39 


c) Behaviour. 

a) Speech . 

Adoption of hush-hush attitude through vanity. 

Confiding in friends to ease nervous strain. 

Mentioning facts you are not "outwardly" supposed to know, or 
isolated facts which can be strung together. 

Telling people more than they need to know. 

Compromising telephone-conversations through misuse of 
conventions. (E.g. NOT "Three lambs with sweets and toys who 
need instruction in malaria" BUT "Three chaps with some goods 
for Harry who need instruction in my subject".) 

b) Writing . 

Commit as little as possible to writing. Memorise if you can. 
If you must carry documents, select what you must carry. 

Burn all secret waste and carbons. 

c) Behaviour - 

Be inconspicuous. Avoid all limelight by being an "average" 
citizen in appearance (height, clothes) and conduct (drink, 
women). 

Be tidy. All engaged on secret work must be methodical in 
their habits - e.g. it is mainly knowing exactly where he has 
placed his belongings and arranged his room that an individual 
can detect disturbance by police search. 

Have good "Cover" - the innocent activity undertaken or 
invented to conceal the secret aspects of his activity. Good 
cover must be consistent with necessary overt behaviour and 
non-compromising. 

(For application to operational Agent see A.4.) 

Be observant. Observe and deduce. (E.g. face or voice seen or 
heard twice suggesting you are being followed. Smell of real 
coffee in France suggestion someone occupied in Black Market.) 

Have foresight. See danger early. (E.g. axis agent in cafe, 
policemen checking papers.) 

Plan for emergency. Alternative courses in case of accident 
(RV's) pre-arranged conversation when talking to colleague in 
case of sudden interrogation. Danger signs.

SECURITY FOR W/T OPERATORS 


1. INTRODUCTION 

Lecture deals with special aspects of security for W/T Operators 
apart from general principles laid down in "Individual Security". 

2. CHOOSING OF PREMISES FOR WORKING SET . 

a) Choice depends on ; 

i) Security considerations, 

ii) Technical considerations, 

iii) Combination of i. and ii. and district.

i) Thinly populated country districts, possibility for 
isolated buildings, e.g. farms, etc. 

ii) Towns - private house or place of occupation. 

e) In case of d) ii) above, consider following factors: 

i) Accessibility . 

Operator must be able to get to and from premises without 
arousing suspicions of neighbours or passers by. 

ii) cover.

COVER 


A.4. 

November, 1943. 


1. DEFINITION ■ 

Your cover is the life which you outwardly lead in order to 
conceal the real purpose of your presence and the explanation 
which you give of your past and present. It is best considered 
under the heads: 

Past, 

Link between Past and Present, 

Present and "Alibis". 


2. YQU R PAST . 

Before your departure, with the assistance of your Section 
Officers, you will probably prepare the story of your past life 
up to the time of your arrival. But you cannot always arrange a 
complete story before leaving; furthermore, you may have to 
change part or all of your cover story when you are actually in 
the field and know what your circumstances are to be. 

Nevertheless you must be able to give some account of yourself if 
questioned immediately after your arrival. 

In inventing or amending your cover story, or that of another 
agent, the following points should be considered: 

a) Identity. 

i) Your Own. 

Advantages: Your story will be mainly true. Only a 

limited period will have to be explained 
away. Records will confirm your 
statements. 

Disadvantages: The subversive part of your history may 

be known to the enemy or to persons who 
may give you away. This is usually the 
case with escapees. 

ii) That of a Real Person. Distant or Dead . 


Advantages: The story, being real, will be self- 

consistent. Records will confirm at 
least a part of it. 


Disadvantages: People acquainted with the person whom 

you are impersonating may give you away. 
You may have incomplete information 
about this person's past life, so that 
your statements may be shown to be 
untrue. The person may be suspected 
without your knowing it. 










SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 47 


iii) Wholly Fictitious . 

Advantages: Less chance of entanglements and wider 

scope. 

Disadvantages: Records will not confirm your story. 

In some cases agents have to assume different identities in 
different places. This should be avoided as far as possible 
because it leads to contradictions. 

N.B. The danger of two identity cards. 

b) H is tory.. 

i) Whatever your identity, your story must be plausible and 
not indicate any connection with subversive activity. 

ii) It should be based, as far as possible, on the facts of 
your own life or that of the person whom you are 
impersonating. Do not introduce places or events which 
you do not know nor refer to knowledge which you have 
not. (Do not claim to know of engineering if you do not.) 

iii) Pay particular attention to that part of your story which 
is linked with the details shown in your documents. These 
may be examined closely. 

iv) Your recent history is of most interest to the police. It 
is also most difficult to invent satisfactorily. 
Particular care should be devoted to its preparation. 

v) Although a complete mastery of details is essential in 
the preparation of the story, vagueness is often 
desirable when repeating it, especially in the case of 
more distant and less important parts. 

c) Documents . 

These are supplied by your Section and will be as nearly 
perfect as possible. The following points must be remembered: 

i) You must know how you would have obtained them if they 
had been issued to you legally. 

ii) All the documents you need cannot always be produced in 
this country, e.g. those which change frequently, such as 
ration cards in some countries. 

iii) The falsity of forged documents is always ultimately 

detectable if counterfoils exist, especially if they are 
numbered consecutively. It may take a long time to 
establish this falsity. 






48 SOE SYLLABUS 


iv) Perfect documents can only be obtained through official 
sources in the field. 

d) Clothes and Effects . 

i) Do not take anything with you which does not fit your 
story. 

ii) Your effects can sometimes furnish valuable corroborative 
evidence of the "truth" of your background cover, e.g. 
unofficial papers, tickets, bills, local products, etc. 

e) Change of Appearance . 

i) To support assumed character (rough hands for workman). 

ii) To avoid recognition if you are going among people who 
know you. 

N.B. Application of disguise is dealt with in a special 
lecture. 

f) Final Search 

You must search your person and residence for traces which 
link you with your "other self": 

i) Before your departure. 

ii) Whenever you change your cover story 

iii) If you wish to conceal some recent activity. 

iv) If you are about to undertake some special subversive act. 

3. FROM PAST TO PRESENT 

As soon as you arrive you must adopt a cover life to account for 

your presence. Your cover story for your past must merge into 

this. 

a) From the beginning start completing the details of the cover 
story of your past. Really do the things you say you have 
done. Really go to the places you say you have been to. This 
will serve a double purpose: 

i) You will obtain the information which you would have had 
had your story been true, e.g. see the towns, learn their 
recent history, etc. With this knowledge you can support 
and, if necessary, modify your background cover. 

ii) You can manufacture evidence confirming your background 
cover, e.g. make acquaintances in the places you go to, 
possess things coming from these places. 







SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 49 


b) Build up also your present cover background by innocent and 
inconspicuous actions to which reference can be made later. It 
may be useful to make innocent acquaintances, etc. 

YOUR PRESENT . 

This is the life which you lead and the story which you will tell 
about that life to account for your presence. It may be planned 
with the help of your Section Officers before your departure. Or 
you may have to work it out for the first time after your 
arrival. In any case, your ostensible present must be consistent 
with your alleged past. 

a) Mai nt enan ce Qf Co v er . 

i) Name . 

Always sign correctly and respond to it immediately, 

ii) Consistency in general 

Your personality and general conduct must fit your cover 
background, e.g.: 

Expenditure must accord with ostensible income. 

Volume and nature of correspondence must fit your social 
circumstances. 

Character of friends and acquaintances must accord with 
your cover personality. 

Documents, clothing, possessions, etc. must be suitable. 
Manners, tastes, bearing, accent, education and knowledge 
must accord with your ostensible personality. 

iii) Concealment of Absence from your Country . 

Avoid foreign words, tunes, manners, etc. 

Avoid slang which has developed among your countrymen in 
Britain. 

Avoid showing knowledge or expressing views acquired in 
Britain. 

Conform with all new conditions which have arisen, 
observe new customs and acquire the language which has 
developed in your country. 

b) Cover Oc cu pation . 

It is advisable for you to have, or pretend to have, a cover 
occupation. (A real one is best, but sometimes their 
subversive activity does not permit agents to do other work.) 
An occupation is necessary: 

i) To account for presence in locality. 

ii) To explain the source of livelihood. 








50 SOE SYLLABUS 


iii) To avoid, if possible, conscription for work in Germany 
or elsewhere. 

In selecting a cover occupation, bear in mind the 
possibilities of havings 

i) An unregistered job such as student, stamp dealer. 

ii) An imaginary job. In this case it is an advantage if you 
have a real employer to vouch for you. 

Your range of choice of occupation is restricted by certain 
factors. Some of these factors apply also to an imaginary job. 
Consider the following: 

i) Some jobs involve special investigation of credentials 
and/or restriction of liberty. 

ii) The job which you select should afford you cover and 
facilities for your activity. Consider hours, pay, 
movement, technical facilities, e.g. transport, storage, 
access, etc. 

iii) You must have adequate technical qualifications. 

c) conclusion• 

Good background cover is hard to build up and easily 
destroyed. It is essential to your relations with the general 
public. Never sacrifice such cover once acquired if you can 
possibly avoid it. 

Remember, however, that a serious investigation is likely to 
break down your background cover by exposing the falseness of 
your documents or statements about your past life. Always, 
therefore, avoid trouble with the authorities. Have a ready 
story to account for everything. 

In some cases an ostensible lawful existence is impossible. 
Then you must live underground. Be inconspicuous. Avoid 
officials. Vary your appearance, habits, haunts, routes, etc. 
Produce one story or another as the occasion demands. 

5. "ALIBI" . 

a) Nature of "Alibi" . 

In addition to your cover background, you must have an 
explanation ready for every subversive act, however small, 
e.g. conversation, journey. Such alibis are more important 
than your background cover. If they are good no further 
enquiries will be made. 

You may be questioned about your activity in many different 
circumstances and have to conceal its true nature, e.g. when 





SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 51 


obtaining permits, telephoning, by regular or snap controls, 
through infringing regulations or being called as a witness, 
through suspicious activity when under surveillance. 

b) Construction of an "alibi". 

Remember the following points: 

i) Plausibility . If you give a plausible explanation of 
your conduct no further investigation is likely. An 
unplausible story will be investigated and must, 
therefore, be watertight. 

ii) Detail . Decide on the "facts" which must be prepared in 
detail and those which can be left vague, e.g. people 
remember times of rendezvous, trains, etc., but not when 
they have finished meals. 

iii) Self-Consistency . Your "alibi" must be consistent with 
your circumstances, especially those immediately 
ascertainable, e.g. clothes, general appearance, special 
knowledge, activity. 

iv) Cover Background . For choice your "alibi" should be 

consistent with your main cover background, but you may 
have to manufacture special background for the occasion. 

v) Truth . The "alibi" should be as near the truth as 

possible, provided that it is not suspicious. Time can 
be expanded. Dates of events can be transposed. Where 
the story is quite untrue the false parts can often be 
rehearsed. Cf. Build up of cover (above). It is 
dangerous to tell a story entirely untrue. 

vi) Dead End . In so far as is possible the story should be 
closed. It should leave few openings for further 
investigation. Links with outside persons, events or 
places are dangerous. 

vii) Consistency with Others . Persons called upon to corroborate 
your story must do so reasonably accurately. (Consider 
possibility of arrangement by which all questions of a 
certain kind are answered in the same way. E.g. "Describe a 
game of cards exactly as played yesterday" or "Initiative 
in any action always taken by A".) 

viii) Discreditable Storv . Consider the possibility of using 

as an "alibi" an discreditable story. Sometimes this can 
be used as an alternative upon which to fall back should 
the first story break down. 

N.B. Provided that you have not been questioned about your 
alibi, you can change it freely; e.g. one to explain what you 
are going to do, a second to explain what you are doing and a 
third to account for what you have done. 











52 SOE SYLLABUS 


MAKE UP AND DISGUISE 

1. DEFINITION OF DISGUISE. 

a) It does not mean covering your face with grease paint and hair. 

b) It must have as its basis the art of being and living mentally 
as well as physically this new role. The important thing to 
remember is to be the person you are portraying mentally first 
and then afterwards physically. Therefore - EXTERNAL IMITATION 
BY ITSELF IS NOT SUFFICIENT. 

By this we mean imitating the external part of a character 
only, i.e. the walk, the voice the manners and individualities 
etc. of the character. External imitation without proper 
mental preparation must mean you speak and do things 
mechanically without fully realizing who you are, where you 
come from, why, what you want, where you are going, what you 
are supposed to be and do when you get there, etc. You will 
therefore be nothing but an external caricature and easily 
caught out. 

2. OCCASIONS WARRANTING THE USE OF DISGUISE . 

a) Long Term . 

When a well known personality is going back to work in his own 
home town and where, for the safety of himself and his 
organization, he must be unrecognized. (Example, done by 
plastic surgeon). 

b) Short-Term- 

i) Your informant service has told you that the police are 
after you, they have your description and there is nothing 
for it but to get away. 

ii) Occasional contacting jobs. When you do not want to risk 
your own cover. 

iii) Special jobs, E.g. when you have to meet personally one of 
your collaborators arriving in the Country and for added 
protection, if you are seen, people will get a wrong 
description of you. 

iv) Leaving a building under surveillance (This will be more 
of a quick change and the mental side less important) 
(Example - Loise de Bettignies disguised as a maid). 

3. PRELIMINARIES TO DISGUISE . 

a) Disguise must only be used in the case of emergency. 

b) Never allow yourself externally to portray anything that you 
have not inwardly experienced and which is not even 
interesting to you. 








SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 53 


c) Remember in a get-away the police will probably only have a 
description to work on, therefore work with a view to changing 
this description. 

d) The disguise should be chosen and thought out as long as 
possible before you have need of using it so that you can 
adopt it with the maximum of speed and confidence. 

4. POINTS TO BE CONSIDERED IN YOUR DISGUISE . 

a) Golden Rule . 

Never come out of character. By this we mean not only from the 
clothes point of view but from the mental side also, E.g. if 
you are a workman do not wear a white collar and black tie, 
have clean hands and behave like an educated man. 

b) Clothes ■ 

Study in every detail the clothes you are going to wear not 
forgetting small items such as cut, socks, tie, handkerchiefs, 
etc. Different shapes and kinds of hats will alter type. 

Cigarettes, type of newspaper, contents of paper, E.g. 
watches. 

d) Hair 

If it should be long or short, whether it should be tidy or 
untidy. 

e) you r Fa c er 

Whether it should be dirty or clean, whether it should be 
shaved or unshaved, whether it should be pale or sunburnt. 

f) Teeth - 

Whether they should be clean or not. 

g) Hands . 

Nails, dirty or clean, and your hands white or dirty or hard 
worked. 

h) Feet . 

Whether you wear shoes or boots, whether these should be clean 
or dirty. 

i) Mannerisms . 


Practice until your old mannerisms (such as playing with your 









54 SOE SYLLABUS 


right ear, etc.) are forgotten and your new mannerisms have 
become part of you. 

j) Walk. 

If you had any peculiarity in your carriage or your walk, 
practice until you have conquered the old ones and obtained 
new ones. 

k) Handwriting 

For signature or name if needed, educated or not. Whether you 
should sign as if you are used to signing it or whether you 
should handle your pen as though it were strange to you. 

l) Habits. 

Fit your habits to your character, E.g. don't play billiards 
in a cheap caf6 if your new character is not the type of 
person who would. 

m) Associates 

Only associate or try to associate with people who fit in to 
your new life. 

5. HIN T S. QN .HQW TO _CHA N G E YOUR APPEARANCE . 
a) Clot h e st 

These are more easily manipulated than the face. A simple 
straightforward change of clothes, provided that every detail 
is in character, will do wonders to alter your appearance, 

E.g. from your rough gardening clothes, to your best lounge 
suit. The types of clothes one can think out to change the 
appearance are endless. 

Always make your clothes fit the character you are supposed to 
be, E.g. if you are supposed to be a merchant sailor do not 
have suede shoes on. 

Stripes downwards with a single breasted suit make you look 
taller. Checks across with a double breasted suit make you 
look shorter and broader. 

The position of buttons can alter apparent height and weight. 

Round shoulders can be built up by cut, arms shortened by an 
added length of sleeve and vice versa. In general, get the 
reverse effect from your usual descriptions, E.g. if you have 
any deformity such as dropped shoulder, which is usually 
hidden by your tailor, then accentuate this etc. 









SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 55 


b) Hair . 

You should grow your hair longer than normal although there is 
no easy method of increasing hair growth, the appearance and 
shape of head can be drastically altered by cutting. 

i) To make dark hair fair or grey . 

Preparations - "Bitza" - ready for use. Peroxide - bought 
in small bottles. Max Factor hair whitener. 

Methods of use for all the above - Pour into saucer and 
with small tooth brush apply to the hair, keeping the 
mixture away from the skin. Let it dry and as it dries it 
will lighten the hair. Apply again and it will be lighter 
still. If only the sides of the hair are done it will give 
a grey effect. 

Time needed - 1 hour 

ii) To make silv er or wh ite h flir...ga_.da£te r I . 

Preparation s - Black charcoal powder. 

Method of use - Apply powder to hair with brush, rub in 
with the fingers, comb and brush. Continue this until the 
colour is satisfactory. 

iii) Forehead . 

Nothing can be done to change the shape of this except by 
wearing head gear. 

iv) Eyebrows. 

These can be easily bleached or darkened in the same 
manner as for the hair. 

Accessories - Tweezers and oily substance. 

Method of Use - If thick they can be cut, and if needed 
plucked. If plucked apply a little talcum powder to take 
away the redness. Apply a little oil to smooth them down. 

If eyebrows meet, shave above the nose and apply talcum 
powder. 

If thin and sleek, with the aid of a brown and black 
pencil, and by following the natural growth of the hair, 
pencil in lines and then smooth with finger. Then comb the 
eyebrows against their natural growth which will help to 
hide the pencil mark and give a rugged effect. 













56 SOE SYLLABUS 


v) Eyes ■ 

Accessories - Dark grey grease paint, coal dust or soot; 
Red make up pencil and Duo-liquid adhesive. Brown or black 
pencil. Grease. 

Method of use - If eyes are very large and prominent shape 
the eye-lids with soot or blue grease liner, shaping the 
eye-lids and underneath the eye, following the usual bag 
line, and with a spot of grease blend in. Then with the 
red pencil work round the inside of the lower eyelid. This 
will give you a ready, bagged half closed eye. With your 
adhesive, fix the upper eye-lie over your eyes, which 
gives a small squinting eye. To brighten the eye follow 
the natural eyelash line with the brown pencil and blend 
in. 


vi) Ears. 

Preparation - Duo-liquid adhesive. 

Method of use - Apply this liquid to the back of your ear 
and hold your ear against your head for two to five 
minutes. This will stick the ear close to the head and 
will last approximately 24 hours. The same can be done 
with the lobe of the ear. 

vi) Nose . 

Accessories - End of fountain pen liner tube, two small 
round nuts. 

Method of use - Bore holes in the nuts and place them 
inside the nostrils. This will give a very squashed tipped 
nose and it is possible to breathe quite freely. 

vii) Mous tach es . 

If students are growing moustaches before leaving it is 
advisable to grow very large and very thick ones, as by 
cutting or shaving different shapes can be obtained. 

Moustaches can also be darkened or bleached. For quick work 
we can have made-up moustaches of any shape and size on 
hair lace. This, with the aid of a little spirit gum can be 
stuck on in a minute and removed if needed in two seconds. 
The effect of a different shaped moustache on a face is 
quite staggering. 

ix) Teeth . 

If a student merely wants to discolour his teeth, iodine is 
very useful. 










SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 57 


x) Cheeks . 

Rubber pads can be inserted in the cheeks which alter the 
shape completely of the lower half of the face. These can 
be made by the student himself from sponge. 

xi) Cleft Chin . 

A little wax applied, mixed with a little rouge and worked 
into the cleft takes away the cleft. 

xii) Whole Face . 

For an unshaven appearance, with a small piece of porous 
sponge apply brown and dark brown make up. This gives the 
desired effect by merely dabbing the make-up on to the side 
of the face. Soot or coal-dust, if used with a porous 
sponge gives the same effect. 

Lines all over the face . Deep lines can be applied to the 
face by simply using a soft black pencil in your own lines. 
Care must be taken only to use the natural lines. 

Dr. Middleton, the Research specialist for Max Factor, has 
been experimenting with skin for a number of years and it 
is thought that he would have small bottles of skin colours 
to alter the colour of the skin as required. 

xiii) To cover Scars . 

Collodian bought at any chemists and found in every 
hospital, can easily be used. 

To make Scars 

Collodian (flexible). Apply to the skin with a brush. The 
skin must be held for a minute and a half to the required 
shape and when the collodian dries the effect of a scar 
remains. As many as needed can be made. 

xiv) To make a Face Younger . 

A very close shave, apply hot towels, then apply alum all 
over the face. This tightens the skin considerably and when 
talcum is applied afterwards gives a fresh young appearance. 

xv) To make a Face Older . 

Experiment with all the foregoing hints. 

xvi) Hands . 


These can be made rough by oil and dirt on the hands, and 
cuts. To get them to look well cared for, have them manicured 
and put ladies' face powder or hand powder over them.

6. CONCLUSION . 

Long term disguise will be an integral part of cover, thus to 
employ it will require careful study and the assistance of 
experts long before the subject leaves for the field. 

Short term disguise should be considered together with the system 
of alternatives that is always urged for the agent (i.e. means of 
communications, H.Q., reputation, hide-out and appearance). As a 
security measure to be employed in an emergency requires study 
and practice in advance if to be successful. 

Sit down quietly and think out your new character mentally, not 
forgetting characteristics such as walk, stance, etc. When this 
is done experiment with your face so that not only is it changed 
but so that it fits in to your new character. 

APPENDIX 

During a sea voyage, Colonel H. had the opportunity of examining the 
growth of 64 beards, all of which were started on the same day. The 
beards were examined on the 19th day, the results being as follows: 

1 true beard and moustache; growth about 3 -V' from face covered with 
good strong moustache well shaped and altering face entirely. 

4 promising ones, little alteration to character of face. 

1 bad beard but entirely altering lines of face giving an 
Elizabethan appearance. 

30 growths that promise to be good beards in a month's time. 

19 very poor, doubtful if they will every develop into beards at all. 
9 N.B.G. ever. 

The best age groups: 23-48 

The worst age groups: 17 - 20 and 41-53 

Generally speaking, men on regular watch on deck are in advance of 
engine room staff (with one exception, a man who has a good crop of 
hair, none on his chest.) 

1 totally bald man is in the group containing 4 promising beards. 

2 totally bald men are in the 30 group. 

7 baldish men in the 30 group. 

1 totally bald) in the 19 very poor group. 

1 baldish ) 

In view of the foregoing, it is suggested that the lecture on hair 
should be amended to read "Moustaches 15 - 25 days, beard 25 - 40 days."

OBSERVATION 


October 1943 


One of the most important ways of being well informed (See A.3) 
is to be observant. 

Just as information has been described as both a defensive and an 
offensive weapon, so observation can be used defensively and 
offensively. 

2. DEF INITION . 

For the agent, observation means: "A general awareness of what is 
going on around you without the appearance of being inquisitive." 

Observation is not confined to seeing but includes hearing, 
smelling and feeling and also includes the power of deduction 
brought into play by the facts that have been noted. 

3. PQWE.RS_OF_OBSERVATION. 

These are: 

Young children are naturally extremely observant. They have 
not, however, developed their power of deduction. 

b) Acquired . 

Powers of observation are lying dormant in every one of us 
and can be revived by practice. 

There are various methods of improving one's power of 
observation according to the type of memory which one may 
possess. 

E.g. Some people have a photographic memory; other people 
can remember better by sound and others by numbers. The 
following method is recommended as being suited to all types 
of memories. 

4. OUR METHOD . 

a) Things . 

i) Take the things that please you - your eyes, touch, 
smell and hearing. Try and express in words why they 
please you. Such an effort will cause you to observe 
the object more closely. 

ii) Take the things that you dislike and repeat the process. 









60 SOE SYLLABUS 


iii) Take the things that are neutral to you and repeat the 
process asking yourself why you have no particular 
feeling towards them. 

b) Human Beings . 

i) Apply the same three processes to the general appearance 
and voice of the person observed. 

ii) Study the person's actions, asking yourself the reason 
for such actions. 

iii) You will have observed by now a lot about a person. Try 
and judge his character. 

5. C ONCLUSION - 

This method requires a conscious effort to begin with and 
systematic practice. It is, however, interesting and has the 
following results: 

i) You will obtain a greater knowledge of the people in 
your area. 

ii) You will have obtained a greater knowledge of objects 
round about you. 

iii) You will be able to notice the presence of strangers, 
the absence of people you know, and anything unusual 
which might previously have escaped you.

OBJECTS AND METHODS OF COUNTER-ESPIONAGE 

1. INTRODUCTION ■ 

A Counter-Espionage Organization is a Service or Governmental 
Agency designed to protect a particular country or area from all 
forms of subversive activity or irregular warfare that "the enemy 
either intends to carry out or is carrying out in that area". 

Counter-espionage is a combination of the activities of various 
Governmental Agencies and is usually concentrated into one 
controlling service, e.g. police, immigration, customs, treasury, 
government security service, radio security, military security - 
the various departments being combined as under M.I.5, Deuxieme 
Bureau, Abwehr, F.B.I. 

2. OBJECTS OF A COUNTER-ESPIONAGE ORGANIZATION . 

a) To prevent agents of the enemy, engaged in any subversive 
activity, from entering a country. 

b) In the event of not achieving this, at least to ensure that 
the agents are rendered conspicuous and thereby detected. 

c) In the event of failing to achieve the first two objectives, 
so to control the country and its population that the 
activities of the agents are neutralized and therefore 
harmless. 

All counter-espionage activity is constantly subject to the 
political and economic influences present in the area 
concerned. Thus, there will always be a conflict as between 
the desire to achieve maximum security through efficient C.E. 
activity, and the need for the economic and politic life of 
the country to continue in as efficient and satisfactory a 
manner as possible. Recognition of this conflict is essential 
in order to evaluate the strength or weakness of counter¬ 
espionage in any country under review. 

3. COUNTER-ESPIONAGE METHODS . 

In order to achieve the three above mentioned objectives, 
counter-espionage practice combines these main activities: 

a) Control regulations. Systems of control exercised over the 
whole population to make an agent's work more difficult and to 
render him conspicuous. 

b) Detective measures. To detect those persons who have 
contravened regulations and made themselves conspicuous, and 
to follow up any activites which are not entirely consistent 
with normal life. 








62 SOE SYLLABUS 


c) Penetration. Counter-espionage will constantly endeavour to 

penetrate the enemy underground organization and activities. 

It can therefore be regarded as a bridge between a) and b). 

4. DETAILED COUNTER-ESPIONAGE PRACTICE . 

a) Control Regulations Preventive. 

i) Identity. 

ii) Movement. 

iii) Communications. 

iv) Publications. 

v) Finance. 

vi) Action. 

b) Detective Measures. 

i) Security lists. 

ii) Snap controls. 

iii) Informant Service. 

iv) Agents provocateurs. 

v) Censorship and d/f. 

vi) Surveillance. 

vii) Searches. 

viii) Interrogations. 

c) Penetration. 

Likely to take one or more of the following forms: 

i) Getting members of counter-espionage organization 
recruited into the enemy underground organization. 

Cf. Police method dealing with the Communist Party. 

ii) Member of C.E. to work in the enemy country or in neutral 
country to endeavour to locate and contact personnel of 
the enemy organization by the use of bad security, 
mislaid documents, jealousies, overhearing conversations 
on the part of the enemy. 

iii) Use of double agents. The capture and subsequent turn 
round of a member of the enemy underground. Using the 
means of communication either to plant misinformation on 
the enemy, or alternatively, to obtain through this 
channel any information concerning the enemy's 
requirements or probable future plans. 

iv) Use of agents provocateurs to provoke persons into making 
indiscreet or revealing statements. Cf. German methods in 
occupied Europe; and ref. 4.b). 



SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 63 


5. 


LOOPHOLES IN C 




^-ESPIONAGE PRACTICE . 


a) Political and economic conditions previously referred to. 
Cf. Foreign workers in Germany; neutral seamen in the U.K., 
World War I and World War IX. 

b) The human element. All C.E. practice is subject to the 
human element and therefore to the weaknesses accruing. 

E.g. bribery, slackness, low intelligence. 

c) Shortage of personnel. Cf. Deterioration of German C.E. 
personnel in Occupied Europe. 

Thus, on the one hand the enemy agent will endeavour to locate 
loopholes in a counter-espionage system since that is the only 
way that he can succeed in evading the attentions of the C.E., 
and on the other hand C.E. will always seek to cover such 
loopholes and to prevent, as far as possible, the enemy agent 
from knowing exactly the methods being employed. Cf. Criminals 
know the existence of detectives but a good detective does not 
reveal his methods.

DESCRIPTIONS 


1. GENERAL . 


You may be called upon to - 

a) Describe a person so that a third party can recognize him from 
your description. 

b) Yourself recognize a person so described. 

c) Extract (innocently or not) such a description from a third 
party. 

2. POLICE ME TH O DS. 

We have no time for a Bertillon system - photographs, finger prints, 
limb measurements. We want a system that is reliable and quick. 

3. CONVENTION . 

Quick recognition of a person in a crowd depends upon quick 
elimination of unrequired persons. 

A person's features should, therefore, be described in the 
following order and under the following headings: 

a) F eat u res ALWAYS Described- 

- Sex 

- Apparent age 

- Height (measure by your own) 

- Build (slight, large, stocky or medium) 

b) Features only Described if DISTINCTIVE . 

i) Permanent, e.g. shape of eyes, adams apple, nose. 

ii) Inpermanent, e.g. moustache, spectacles, hair, clothes and 
effects. 

A few (2 - 4) of these features is all that is necessary. 


The following is a fairly comprehensive list of features, both 
permanent and impermanent , and if distinctive should be observed 
and described methodically. 


Abnormalities such as hunchback or crosseyes will of course 
always be described.

SURVEILLANCE 


A. FOLLOWING ■ 

Successful surveillance requires: 

1. SVIT flEbE TYPE QF FQU &lt;OW SP . 

- Inconspicuous. (Always under medium height.) 

- Tenacious. 

- Intelligent and resourceful. 

- Observant. 

- Experienced in the work. 

- Possessing first-class knowledge of district. 

2. INFORMATION ON SUSPECT . 

- Character and habits. (E.g. smoker, drinker, lazy, sociable.) 

- Business and private addresses. 

- Normal movements in business and leisure. 

- When and where surveillance is likely to take place. 

- What is required to be found out about suspect. 

3. PLANNING . 

a) Cover . 

Following is rarely done by single person, more frequently 
by combination of several with various types of cover, E.g.: 

- Taxicab driver with vehicle. (Largely "blown".) 

- Tradesman's van with driver. 

- Tradesman or messenger with bicycle. 

- Shoppers, house or apartment-hunters. 

- Man with girl. 

- Woman with baby carriage. 

b) Met hod . 

Must be carefully worked-out in advance. E.g. 

- Whether by one or more persons. 

- Division of labour in emergency. 

- Sign to denote whether or not you have lost the suspect. 

4. EQUIPMENT . 

In general follower requires this personal equipment: 

- Dark, inconspicuous clothes whose appearance fits relevant 
locality. 










68 SOE SYLLABUS 


- Waterproof raincoat. 

- Quiet shoes. 

- Money with plenty of small change. 

- Watch. 

- Pencil and notebook. 

- Food. 

- Cigarettes and/or pipe. (Stopgap for awkward waits and cover 
for looking around.) 

- Reading material. (To be read only in suitable environment.) 
Hints on equipment: 

a) Always go to the toilet before starting surveillance. 

b) It is possible discreetly to alter your appearance during 
surveillance. E.g. start with hat or raincoat on and later 
take it off; start with dummy package and later leave it at 
check-room. 

5. EXPERT MANOEUVRE . 

a) In the street : 

- Vary distance between yourself and suspect according to 
density of crowd. 

- Use as much physical cover as possible. (E.g. keep street- 
lamps or other people between you and suspect; walk with 
other people, especially when crossing street.) 

- Never stop or start, break into run or slow down at same 
time as suspect. 

- If alone, better to follow on opposite side of street to 
suspect; as this is not only less conspicuous but gives 
better field of vision. (E.g. through shop windows and 
around corners.) 

b) i n pu bl i c ve hi c l e s= 

- Sit on same side as suspect, rather than opposite. 

- Where no flat-rate fare exists, sit in front of suspect 
and let him ask for fare first. 

c) In cafes, regtayran tg_._g£c_.; 

- Chose seat where suspect has his back to you. 

- Order short meals and short drinks. 

- Anticipate his departure by paying check straightaway. 

d) At..a ll ti me.?, and places; 

- Never catch suspect's eye. Use reflections in windows and 
mirrors; look at him when either you or he are drinking. 

B. BEING FOLLOWED . 

1. ASSUMPTION OF SURVFTT,T.ANGE . 

Whenever you are going anywhere with subversive intent assume 











SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 69 


that you are being followed. E.g. here is how a successful 
criminal, whom we interviewed, stated he would move with 
criminal intent from Point A to Point B: 


a) Take a taxicab - but not the first or second that presents 
itself. (Note numbers and descriptions of first and second 
cab and of their drivers, in case they pass you again. If 
they do, you are probably being followed.) 

b) Give your cab-driver wrong address first for benefit of any 
"innocent" bystanders. Change your mind when inside. 

c) Take cab to innocent place in direction of but not at Point 
B. E.g. stores, church or park. 

d) Leave cab and take following precautions to throw-off any 
possible surveillance: 

- Spend some time in large stores, using elevators. 

- Get into crowds. 

- Walk up side street and take sudden turn. 

e) Again take taxicab, repeating precautions above. ( Note : Do 
not look directly out of the rear window. Use reflections, 
or don't look.) 


f) Again go to innocent place near to, but not at, Point B. 

g) Complete journey on foot. 


2 . 


SURVEILLANCE. 


If you are suspicious of definite surveillance, check by 
following methods: 

a) Walk up comparatively empty street and see who follows. 

b) Cross street and see who does likewise. 

c) Enter cafe, restaurant, bar, and see who follows. 

d) Enter small store and see who hangs about outside, 
especially if he attempts to conceal himself. 

e) Leave innocent article (e.g. newspaper, stick) in small 
store, walk away, turn round suddenly and go back for it. 

3. COUNTER-MEASURES TO RURVFTT.T.ftNPF . 

If you know that you are definitely being followed, two 
alternative courses are open to you: 

a) Shake follower off by : 

- Suddenly running to catch public vehicle. (Fail or 
succeed) 





70 SOE SYLLABUS 


- Boarding public vehicles naturally but with good timing. 

- Using elevators in big stores with many exits. 

- Making for open place and move quickly to crowded one. 

b) Lure follower on by : 

- Abandoning all subversive activity and acting innocently. 
E.g. carry on innocent conversations with innocent 
persons; write, mail and/or deliver innocent letters to 
innocent persons; leave harmless articles in innocent 
places; go to the movies, etc. 

4. GENERAL WARNINGS 

In the performance of all security precautions listed under 
Sec. B., the following warnings must be scrupulously heeded: 

a) Never give any sign (either by sudden, undue haste or 
looking round) to show follower that you suspect you are 
being followed. 

b) Have good cover for all "shaking-off", "luring-on" and 
"check" manoeuvres. (E.g. look at watch before running; 
utilize pretty girl, undone bootlace, cigarette-lighting 
and such odd street-noises as backfiring car, for looking 
round.) 

c) If possible ensure that descriptions of all followers are 
circulated among your organization.

PERSONAL SEARCHES 


You may sometimes have to carry secret or subversive material. 

Hence the use of searches by C.E. personnel as an important 

detective measure. 

2. TYPES OF SEARCHES 

(a) pou t in g S earche s: 

Usually a quick frisk for arms, currency, food, taxable or 
dutiable goods, often carried out at or just before arrival. 

(i) At fixed places such as frontiers, demarcation lines. 

(ii) At fixed times such as market days (occupied countries) 
or before visits to important personalities (all 
countries). 

(iii) Irregular - anywhere and at anytime - as a snap 
control. 

(b) Sp ecial Searches 

Usually only undertaken in case of definite suspicion. 

Here, in chronological order, is outline of perfect body 
search as it should be undertaken by a completely efficient 
police force. 

If you are going to conduct a body search, this is the model 
to be aimed for. if you have to undergo a body search watch 
for lapses from this standard. 

(i) Suspect may be taken unaware - either by sudden arrest 
or by the pretence that routine search only is about to 
take place. 

(ii) Suspect may be kept under close observation, not 

allowed to see friends, leave nothing behind or throw 
anything away, not permitted to eat, drink, smoke or go 
to the toilet. 

(iii) Suspect may be left ostensibly alone to see if he tries 
to destroy or dispose of anything. 

(iv) Baggage may or may not be searched in suspect's 
presence. 








72 SOE SYLLABUS 


(v) Hands up against wall with feet well apart is good 
method for one individual alone searching another. 

(vi) Search carried out methodically by working from head to 
foot. 

Body : 

Assistance of doctor sometimes required for physical 
examination. 

Clothes : 

Unsearched clothes on one table - searched clothes on 
another. 

(vii) Suspect kept under observation throughout by non¬ 
searcher to note reactions - e.g. anxiety or (often 
more dangerous) relief. 

(viii) Suspect usually not interrogated until after search but 
police may try to trip him into indiscreet remarks in 
casual conversation. 

(ix) Suspect once searched is not allowed to regain contact 
with unsearched persons; even though released he may be 
kept under surveillance for a considerable time. 

3. COUNTER MEASURES 

In general an agent must not attract attention - e.g. by wearing 
or carrying anything conspicuous or inappropriate. Best never to 
carry incriminating materials; but if it cannot be avoided, note 
the following: 

(a) Advance Plans : 

Most important for agent to decide before hand between two 
alternatives: 

(i) That he will try to get rid of the article if searched. 

(ii) That he will conceal it as thoroughly as possible and 
not try to move it. 

(i) In the first case he must leave it readily accessible 
(e.g. in hand or pocket) for disposal (e.g. by dropping 
it or planting on an innocent person). 


Note : 


Use edible or soluble paper for messages. 

In the case of a bulky article (e.g. radio set in suit¬ 
case), you may be able to abandon or disown it - in 
which case it is necessary to see that it cannot be 
traced to you in anyway. 






SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 73 


(ii) If article is thoroughly concealed, it will probably not 

be found in a routine search, but remember: 

- Use silk paper or cloth for messages to avoid 
rustling. 

- Use dummy padding to give clothing similar appearance 
in similar places. 

- Police should know the method of search in which one 
feels both sides of a coat, both lapels, etc. 
simultaneously. 

- If message is sewn into clothing, appropriate type of 
thread must be used and stitches must be similar to 
those already there. 

All possible hidin g places have glreg d y been used - But: 

Try to choose one that is as difficult to get at as 
possible - e.g. by mixing article with anything of 
which you have a quantity, such as tobacco shreds, 
potatoes. 


(b) Counter Measures During Search 

(i) Find out if possible the object of the search and act 
accordingly. 

(ii) Your attitude must be consistent with your cover (e.g. 
indignation, resignation, indifference, nervousness.) 

(iii) Your reactions will be watched. Therefore never show 
anxiety at critical moments or relief when they are 
passed. 

(iv) If may be possible to confuse the methods of the 

searcher (e.g. by putting unsearched article amongst 
those that have already been searched). 

(v) It may be possible to put police on wrong scent, either 
simply by showing anxiety when they are examining some 
innocent article or (better still) by letting them find 
some minor incriminating article (e.g. currency or 
liquor) and ignoring real article.

HOUSE SEARCHES 


1. GENERA L. 


A search, if properly carried out, will meet with success in 
finding the article being searched for, or will at least obtain 
the knowledge that the article is not there. If the search is 
carried out in a "slipshod" manner there is always a doubt as to 
whether it may not still be there. 

There are two distinct types of House Searches: 

a) The search of a building whilst occupied. 

b) The search of a building in secret, unknown to the occupants. 
2. SEARCH OF A BUI LDING W HILS T OCCUP IED- 

a) Preparations. 

i) information required . 

- Premises: As complete a plan as possible of the house, 
surroundings and such items as telephone, sewers, 
electricity, gas, etc. should be obtained. It may be 
necessary to do this by personal reconnaissance, seen or 
unseen according to the circumstances. 

- Occupants: All possible information concerning the 
occupants including dogs, cats, geese or other domestic 
animals should be obtained. 

ii) How Obtained . 

- Official information. 

- Informant service. 

- Personal reconnaissance, 

iii) Personnel. 

The searching party should be very carefully chosen, 
possibly for their knowledge of the house or district and 
especially for their powers of observation and 
inquisitive natures. 

iv) Plan . 

Know what you are looking for. Decide on the size of the 
search party and make sure that each mam knows what he is 
looking for and exactly what he has to do. The exact time 
of the raid is probably best kept secret from the members 












SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 75 


of the raiding party until the last possible moment. 


b) Entry . 

It is necessary to consider methods of entry for either one 
individual or a party, and to adjust them to requirements along 
the following lines: 

i) The approach should be unobserved and unexpected. 

ii) If more that one entrance is used they should all be 
entered at the same time. 

iii) All entrances should be covered. 

iv) Measures should be taken against alarm being raised. 

v) Speed in taking up positions is essential. 

vi) The search both of persons and premises should be begun as 
quickly as possible. 

c) Actual Search . 

i) Occupants should first be searched and placed under guard 
in a room that has been searched. 

ii) Each room must be searched methodically. E.g. Ceilings, 
walls and the floor, and the latter in a clockwise 
direction or perhaps in sections. 

iii) In searching a room note the following points: 

- Measure inside walls and see that they agree with 
outside measurements. 

- Sound all inside and outside walls. 

- Measure articles of furniture and see that the inside 
and outside measurements agree. 

- Test all woodwork to be sure it is solid. 

- Remove all drawers completely. 

- Remove rugs, carpets, linoleum, etc. and examine the 
floorboards carefully. 

- In basements, sound all rafters and beams for hollow 
places. 

- The simplest and the most inaccessible places are 
generally used for hiding places, depending on the 
nature of the article to be hidden.

SEARCH OF A BUILDING IN SECRET l 




TO THE OCCUPANTS . 


a) The above observations in general apply to this type of 
search. It is more difficult to carry out as every article 
that is searched must be put back in its proper place and in 
the same condition as it was originally. It may have been 
placed deliberately in a certain way in order to inform the 
occupant whether or not it has been disturbed. 

b) Members of the searching party should be chosen particularly 
for their powers of observation. 

c) The person directing the search must exercise strict control 
and also make sure that one room is not searched twice and 
another forgotten. 


4. CONCLUSION . 

The success of all searches will depend on careful preparations, 
careful plans, surprise and methodical searching.

BURGLARY 


1. DEFINITION . 

The secret entry by an agent into premises for the purpose of: 

a) Examining, photographing, stealing documents or articles 
profitable to your organization. 

b) Reconnoitring interior of a building for any subversive 
purpose - E.g. assassination. 

2. GENERAL WARNINGS . 

a) If possible, above objectives should be attained without 
incurring enemy's knowledge or suspicion. 

b) Burglary with subversive intent is best not carried out by leader 
himself but by subordinates - preferably local people who, if 
caught, can use cover of "normal" burglary. (Where necessary, 
objects of value may be removed to substantiate this cover.) 

c) If a genuine burglar is hired or recruited for the job, 
greatest care must be taken that he will not give away 
organization to enemy. 

3. METHOD . 

The following information has been obtained from police and very 

reliable criminal sources: 

a) INFORMATION NEEDED . 

i) Number of occupants, 

ii) Habits of occupants. 

- Meal-times (Especially evening). 

- Normal times of departure and return. 

iii) Silent and covert lines of approach and retreat. 

- Use lawns and grass-borders. 

- Avoid gravel, flower-beds, dust, dirt and mud. 

iv) If dog present, discover situation of kennel. 

- Naturally noisy dog not so dangerous as normally silent 
one. 

- Use of aniseed for decoy, or poisoned-meat for killing. 









78 SOE SYLLABUS 


v) Situation and state of windows, doors (impression of key) 
and ladders. 

b) HOW OBTAINED . 

i) Best obtained from "insider" - E.g. maid, gardener, janitor, 
clerk. But risk of subsequent interrogation by police. 

ii) "Outsider" can be useful - E.g. tradesman, plumber, 
carpenter. 

iii) If no informants available, watching by a stranger should 
not exceed 48 hours. 

iv) To establish whether occupants are out or away: 

- Call from pay-station telephone. If someone answers, 
enquiry must be made for person of different name from 
occupants, followed by apology for wrong number. 

(NOTE: This trick is well-known and should be used with 
care.) 

- If house has no telephone, approach front door and ring 
door bell. (Knocking on door of empty house is dangerous 
as it attracts attention.) If door is answered, ask for 
fictitious name and back up story with fake letter. 

c) EQUIPMENT. 

Reconnaissance as outlined under 3. a), and b). will show 
which of following items are necessary: 

i) Chamois leather gloves. 

ii) Dimmed flashlights. 

iii) Key or skeleton-keys and shaped thick wire for turning 
keys left in locks - all carried in black cloth to avoid 
jingle so that they may covertly be thrown away without 
noise in emergency. 

iv) Newspaper for obtaining key from reverse side of door. 

v) Glass-cutter and gummed cloth or paper for breaking 
windows. 

vi) Pair of old, large socks for silent climbing of ladders. 

vii) Length of light-proof material. 

viii) Jemmy or garden-shears (Only to be taken when other 
method of entry impossible.) 

NOTE : Only take what is necessary from above items. 




SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 79 


d) ENTRY. 

i) Personnel . 

- Maximum number for operation is three. Two said to be best. 


ii) Doors . 


- Best method is by key, either made from impression 
(demonstrate) or stolen. 

- Skeleton keys. (Demonstrate) 

- Key left in lock, turned by wire or pushed out and 
pulled under on newspaper. (Demonstrate) 

iii) Windows ■ 

- Find one left open. 

- Cut and break (Break first time. One crash merely wakes 
occupants; two crashes get them out of bed.) 

- Jemmy or garden shears. 

e) EBOCEDURE-AEIB R ENTR Y. 

Dispose your available personnel as follows: 

i) One man standing well back from window, watching probable 
line of approach by police, occupants or other 
interrupters. (To identify returning occupant, see if he 
searches for his keys.) 

ii) One man to make certain of alternative exits in case of 
alarm. Having made sure of these, he watches opposite 
side of house to "window-man", or, if burglary takes 
place at meal-time, he watches for possible interruption 
by occupants. 

iii) Leader searches for what is required. 

Cormunication between members of the party should be by 
agreed sounds and there should be NO talking and no smoking 
during the operation. No cigarette ends should ever be left 
anywhere in the neighbourhood of a burglary as chemical 
analysis of saliva helps very much to identify persons. 

f) METHOD OF SEARCH 

i) Before search starts, arrange delaying action to prevent 
surprise: 

- If light is on in the room, leave it on but lock the 
door or place table against it. 







80 SOE SYLLABUS 


- If light is not on, remove bulb and do not block the door. 

If a light must be put out, the silent method is to take 

out the bulb instead of turning the switch, which will 

make a click. 

ii) In general, do not alter any existing dispositions. If 
something must be taken away, consider possibility of 
leaving a similar-looking object. 

iii) Search systematically, starting with some definite object in 
the room and working in one direction round the room, one 
man only doing the search; another may assist, E.g. by 
holding the torch and tools, but should not interfere, so as 
to avoid any confusion. 

g) GET-AWAY 

i) if h q al ar m . 

- The party should leave one at a time and not join up 
again. 

- A gang of burglars would have to meet to share proceeds. 
It is interesting to note that their practice in 
arranging personal meetings and danger signals agrees 
with teaching in lecture A.18. 

ii) if disturbed.and- fll apn-aiagn• 

- If running away, pretend there is some joke by bursting 
out laughing and shouting to some imaginary friend. 

- If one member of the party is left in house and is 
hiding while owners have returned, others who have got 
away may break a fire alarm and give the address of the 
house opposite or one near, so as to cause a diversion. 
(This method of diversion is often used by burglars to 
cover entry in the first place.) 50% of the fire alarms 
in London are said to be due to burglaries. 

- Man left in house may nip into toilet and lock door. 

- If a dog is set on to you do not run. Imitate the owner 
and repeat what he says to encourage the dog to search 
for the third party. 

- If you encounter someone unexpectedly always have story 
ready and speak to them before they address you. 

h) PRECAUTIONS AGAINST BEING FOLLOWED . 


(See A.8.) 






SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 81 


i) BORROWING CARS . 

If it ever happens that borrowing a car is possible: 

- Numbers should be changed by means of shaped pieces of white 
and black gummed paper. (N.B. red and white in Belgium). 
Letters of the registration should not be changed, nor 
should the number of figures be reduced or increased. After 
the job the car may be left stranded somewhere. 

- When waiting by a car for an accomplice, pretend to be 
pumping up the tyre rather than doing anything to the 
engine. It is suspicious if you have to leave in a hurry 
immediately after feigning engine trouble.

INTERROGATION 


1. GENERAL 

Interrogations can be divided into three classes: 

a) Carried out by Local Police . Generally on account of 
infringement of minor regulations. Usually confined to four 
simple questions. 

- Who are you? 

- Where do you come from? 

- what papers have you? 

- What are you doing? 

NOTE : Immediately after arrival, you should be prepared to 
answer plausibly these questions: 

- Who are you? 

- Where do you come from? 

- How did you come? 

- Where are you going? 

- Who is and where is the last person you spoke to who knows 
you personally? 

- Give details of this locality. 

If able to satisfy the police on all above points, suspect is 
generally released. In the event of any discrepancies he will 
be subjected to further interrogation. 

b) Carried out by Specialist Police . To find out whether a person 
is definitely suspect, e.g. through having failed to satisfy 
the local police in the preliminary interrogation. Suspect 
will have to satisfy the police that his "story" and papers 
are genuine. His replies will probably be checked. Attempts 
may be made to catch him out by producing facts which he 
thinks the Gestapo does not know. 

c) Carried out by Gestapo . or equivalent authority, after arrest. 
For a person seriously suspected, e.g. because he has failed 
to satisfy local police and Gestapo in previous 
interrogations. This interrogation may last from 24 hours to 
many months. Methods are manifold but aim is single - to 
extract a confession. No rules; nothing barred; "all in". 

2. INTERROGATION METHODS , 
a) Before_I.nterrogation. 

i) Exhaustive enquiries about suspect's life and activities 
in order to collect as much evidence as possible before 
interrogation. 











SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 83 


ii) Two types of arrest: 

- Sudden and violent arrest at midnight or in small hours 
when vitality is at its lowest. 

- Sudden but polite arrest on pretext of unimportant 
inquiry, followed by indefinite detention to prevent 
warning of associates. 

iii) Complete personal and house search (See A.9 and A.10.) 

iv) Treatment in prison, all part of interrogation plan, e.g. 
bad food and good food alternately; comfort and 
discomfort; comparative liberty and solitary confinement; 
promising visits from friends, etc. Object is to break 
down moral strength before actual questioning. 

b) D ur ing i nterrogation . 

i) Discomfiture of Prisoner. 

- Prisoner facing strong light; unable to see examiner 
properly. 

- Prisoner with back to examiner, arms above head. 

- Prisoner seated on uncomfortable chair. Not allowed to 
eat, drink or smoke while examiners indulge all three. 

- Single interrogation may continue indefinitely so that 
prisoner becomes exhausted. 

- Examination may be carried out by two or more persons 
acting simultaneously or, more usually, in sequence, e.g.: 

First Interrogator usually the "bully" type who tries to 
make prisoner either angry or frightened; impresses on 
him the terrible power of the Gestapo ("Wir wissen 
alles!"); threatens, throws things about. 

Sec ond Interrogator puts clear, concise, sharp questions. 

If results are unsatisfactory, prisoner may be "beaten up." 

Third Interrogator : friendly, offering food, drink, 
cigarettes and apologising for rough treatment; will try 
to lull prisoner into indiscretion. Probably most 
dangerous type. 

ii) Tricks of Questioning. 

- Long silence in which interrogator appears to forget 
prisoner; this is intended to produce unsolicited remarks. 

- Long silence in which prisoner is discouraged from 
talking. "Don't answer yet. Just think. Just try to 






84 SOE SYLLABUS 


remember what happened - and then tell us the truth." 

- Continually referring back to the same question with a 
different method of approach. 

- Reconstruction of offence exaggerating prisoner's share 
in it. 

- Reconstruction of events by interrogator who gives half 
the circumstances in great detail. Later the prisoner is 
ordered to repeat what he has been told. If he was, in 
fact, present when the events took place he may easily 
include details which were not given by the interrogator. 

- Suggestion that prisoner has been let down by his friends 
or is shielding someone else. 

- Showing prisoner a "confession" signed by a colleague. 

- Firing squad used as bluff. 

- Threats to family. 

- Use of other to soften prisoner's will-power. 

- Giving prisoner papers to sign after exhausting day of 
interrogation 

3. C.O. WTER-MEA S. URES 

a) Before Interrogation . 

- If in same prison cell as other members of organization, say 
nothing; danger of microphone. 

- If allowed to mix with other detained persons, say nothing; 
danger of "stool-pigeons". 

- Beware of "friendly nurses" sent to see if you need anything. 

- Beware of mirrors in your cell. Observers stationed behind 
cell-wall can observe your actions through "two-way" mirror. 

- Be careful of your actions when released, either before or 
after interrogation; release may only be temporary in order 
to watch your movements. 

- Always try to appear clean, neat and, if possible, well 
dressed. 

b) During Interrogation . 

- Speak slowly, clearly and firmly. Do not answer simple 
questions immediately and hesitate with the more difficult 
ones. 





SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 85 


- Do not be clever or abusive. Create impression of being 
averagely stupid, honest citizen, trying his best to answer 
questions intelligently. Interrogators are not impressed by 
tears or heroics. 

- Avoid replies that lead to further questions. All your 
answers should end in a cul-de-sac. 

- Deny everything you cannot explain. Do not attempt to get 
round difficulties by altering or embellishing your stories. 

- Arrange for code sign in text or signature on any statement 
extracted by force. 

- Do not express personal affection or interest in anybody. 

- Beware of apparently foolish interrogator of whom you think 
you have got the better. This may be a trap to tempt you to 
boast of your cleverness in circumstances where your 
boastings will be reported. 

- Do not be bluffed by the interrogator who pretends to a 
knowledge of your British connections. It is likely that 
over a period of time the Germans may have learned some 
facts about this Organization, e.g. location of H.Q., 
Schools, etc., or names of personnel. By referring to these 
they may hope to persuade you that they know much more. 
Insist upon your complete ignorance of all facts referred 
to. 

- If subjected to ether, start counting to yourself. When 
questioned you will answer only with the numbers that are 
passing through your mind. 


If you cure arrested by the Gestapo, do not assume that all is 
lost; the Gestapo's reputation has been built up on ruthlessness 
and terrorism, not intelligence. They will always pretend to know 
more than they do and may even make a good guess, but remember 
that it is a guess; otherwise they would not be interrogating 
you.

AGENT MANAGEMENT 

MOTIVES 


1. INTRODUCTION . 

The success of the organization is going to depend on the quality 
and work of the individual members, therefore it is impossible to 
over-estimate the importance of picking the right people. No good 
rushing the job, every single potential helper must be carefully 
studied and the question of security considered before any 
approach is made. 

2. WHAT TYPES OF HELPERS WILL BE REQUIRED? 

a) Regular agents and sub-agents of all kinds (see lecture on 
Organization). 

b) Individuals from whom some special service may be required 
(e.g. overlook some infringement, or persuading someone to do 
so, obtaining papers, providing refuge, abstaining from 
denunciation, etc.) 

c) Information contacts. 

3. HO W IP. M 4 KE-PEQELE- W QRK._FQ B _¥.Q.U. 

a) Sum up your quarry and judge what motive is most likely to 
appeal to him. 

b) Dress up your story to fit in with the motive you have 
selected. 

c) Make the suggestions come from him if possible. 

4. LIKELY MOTIVES AND HOW TO APPEAL TO THEM . 

People usually act from a complex of motives, but there is 
generally one that is uppermost. 

a) Patriotism . 

There are plenty of genuine patriots willing to take risks for 
anyone working against the enemy. The danger here is that in 
order to persuade such a person to do the service for you it 
may be necessary to disclose information about your 
organization and activities. Therefore, while patriotism is 
possibly the best motive to work on when recruiting agents it 
is dangerous when requiring isolated services. 












SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 87 


b) Religious or Political Motives ■ 

Also more suitable for recruiting agents than for obtaining 
isolated services. Possibility of influencing the activities 
of religious or political groups or individuals - but danger 
of disagreements over policy. 

c) Need . 

The ruling motive with many because of privation suffered by 
themselves and by their families. In enemy occupied countries 
it is often extremely difficult to obtain an adequate 
livelihood. Therefore a regular wage (which is quite different 
from bribery, and is merely a reward for time or services 
given) may prove a great attraction, either as a whole time 
job or to supplement an insufficient income from another 
employment. This can be used to reinforce either a), or b). 

Sometimes it is not money that is needed so much as certain 
articles or services. The agent must find out what is needed 
that he can offer, e.g. 

Products ; Food - tobacco - petrol - medicine - clothes - etc. 

Services: Communications - employment - escapes - payment of 
fines - lodgings - etc. 

The fulfillment of such a need may stimulate gratitude on the 
part of the recipient; or the whole transaction may be 
regarded as a regular exchange of services. 

d) Hatred of Germans . 

Many people have a purely personal hatred of the Germans, 
having suffered much at their hands. An agent can appeal to 
than by showing that the service required will spite or 
inconvenience the Germans, without disclosing the subversive 
nature of his activities. 

e) Love of Adventure . 

Especially among young people. Comparisons may be drawn between 
those fighting in the front line and those left at home. 

The above are all good motives as a basis for recruiting conscious 
collaboration. Certain other motives can also be used as a lever 
for obtaining services or restraining dangerous elements. 

i) Personal Sympathy . Especially from women. An agent can 

represent himself as persecuted, hungry, victimised by the 
Germans, etc. 

ii) Greed . There are many people who are not in need but whose 
greed will respond to bribery whether by money or in kind. 










88 SOE SYLLABUS 


N.B. 

The agent must take note of the customs of the country, the 
recipient's profession and class and his personal 
character. If open bribery is unsuitable there are many 
methods of covert bribery (e.g. putting the man in a 
position to receive money in an incidental way, at cards, 
in business transactions, by presents to his wife, thus 
"preserving the decencies"). Obviously a man who is bribed 
is untrustworthy. 

iii) Sex . Procuration in one form or another may be useful in 
some cases. The services of someone outside the 
organization should be employed in order to avoid any 
dangerous consequences. 

iv) Self-importance . E.G. a local official who dislikes Nazi 
supervision. An agent may be able to flatter him by giving 
him a good reputation to live up to and may persuade him to 
take his own decisions irrespective of the Nazis; or the 
same result may be achieved by taunts. 

v) Snobbery . Titled people can sometimes be used to attract 
the attention and goodwill of snobs. 

vi) Fear . Although it is wisest to avoid blackmail as far as 
possible, it may be useful in an emergency, and for that 
reason any information about people's private lives and 
weaknesses should be remembered.

AGENT MANAGEMENT 

RECRUITING 


1. INTRODUCTION 

Having considered the general question of what types of agents 
are required, and the kind of motives which are likely to appeal 
to them, we now come to the question of actual recruiting. 

At first the organizer will want to recruit his principal 
subordinates himself. Later on best for his chief sub-agents to 
recruit their own subordinates. This process may be carried still 
further down the scale, or, as an alternative, special agents may 
be appointed as recruiters. 

Since recruiting is the most dangerous part of subversive 
activity the utmost care must be exercised, and the following 
three principles adopted: 

(a) qo Slow• 

Quality must come before quantity (although certain types of 
subversive activity need large scale organization to be 
effective). The necessity for maintaining the utmost security 
by only recruiting reliable men is particularly important 
during the early stages, when the organizer is selecting men 
to be his principal assistants and creating the nucleus of 
his organization. 

b) Reta in, th e- initiative • 

Persons who offer their services to the organizer should 
always be looked upon with suspicion, as this is a favourite 
method adopted by agents provocateurs. 

c) Man should be recruited for.the job - not vice versa . 

The organizer may make a note of people who may be useful to 
him later on but he should not recruit them until he has work 
for them to do, as otherwise there will be a dangerous period 
of hanging about. Incidentally, recruiting the man for the job 
will, in most cases, eliminate difficulties of finding cover. 

2. QUALITIES OF THE GOOD RECRUITER . 

a) He must inspire confidence, both nationally and personally. 

i) Nationally . The mission he is about to propose may 

involve considerable risks, and it is therefore essential 
that the person he approaches should regard him as 
completely above suspicion. 











90 SOE SYLLABUS 


ii) Personally . Even though the recruiter is regarded as 

above suspicion on national grounds, the person whom he 
approaches (who may be a family man) may still regard him 
as being too young and inexperienced, or may doubt his 
discretion. 

b) Whatever his walk of life, the recruiter should be a man of 
the world, capable of talking easily to comparative strangers, 
and, better still, of handling men. The involves taking an 
obvious interest in the contact and giving him a certain sense 
of importance, being a good listener, etc. 

c) It is often a good plan to do some small service, or to ask 
for one, as this creates a certain sense of obligation on 
either side. 

3. METHODS OF . FINDING ASENTg . 

This will depend entirely on the kind of area allotted to the 

organizer, to the tasks he wishes to be performed, and to the 

types of agents he has set himself to find. The following are 

some general hints: 

a) Table groups which are likely to provide a good field for 
recruits. Such might be:- Ex-soldiers' organizations, trade 
unions, professions, societies (e.g. freemasons), religious 
communities, etc. 

b) Table likely individuals. Consider their character, integrity 
and intelligence, their known opinions. Those who have 
suffered themselves or whose families have been persecuted are 
potential recruits. 

Caution . Beware of those who air their grievances too loudly. 

c) Collect all the information you can about the potential 
recruit. All information is useful, particularly concerning 
his weak points (both of character and of position - e.g. if 
any members of his family are in the hands of the enemy); such 
information may avoid prejudicing security and may also afford 
a useful hold on him later. It is also important to find out 
what motives are most likely to prompt him to action against 
the enemy. (See A.12) 

In recruiting women, information about their personal 
attachments is most useful. These may prove dangerous; and on 
no account should a woman be recruited who is motivated solely 
by sentiment. 

d) Do not touch anybody whom you know (or suspect) to work for 
another organization. If anything ever happens to that 
organization, the whole of your own may be involved in the 
disaster. 

e) Beware of the professional agent who is prepared to work for 





SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 9t 


several organizations. Some agents in the last war sold their 
information to as many as five different intelligence 
services. 

4. APPROACHING THE POTENTIAL RECRUIT . 

Security is the main consideration and the recruiter should be as 
certain as possible of his man before approaching him. 

a) Introduction . 

If the recruiter can be introduced through a third party this 
will save time and may make a quicker judgment of his 
suitability possible - provided that the third party is 
himself a reliable judge. 

If the recruiter has to introduce himself he should try to do 
so in such a way that the other man feels that he himself has 
made the first move. Use of the confidence trick. 

b) Getting down to business . 

Should always be done in such a way that the recruiter does 
not commit himself and is able to withdraw if the results are 
likely to be unsatisfactory. 

If possible concrete suggestions should always come from the 
recruit. The conversation may be directed in such a way as to 
make this possible. 

The recruiter should watch his reactions to any remarks about 
opposition to the Germans and subversive activities in general. 

The recruiter may ask questions or make hypothetical remarks 
which do not cormit him but may elicit a definite statement from 
the recruit, e.g. "I wonder how they organize these sabotage 
attacks... It must be very dangerous to carry out subversive 
activity ... The trouble is reprisals - family ties, etc." 

The recruiter should never over-persuade the man. On the contrary 
he should shew him all the difficulties and dangers of the job. 

He should create the impression that he belongs to a big and 
efficient organization. 

He should disclose no real information about the organization. 
It may be best to pose as an intermediary whose knowledge is 
limited. He should not reveal his own identity or address. 

5. INITIATION . 

In some cases some kind of initiation ceremony may have a useful 
effect on the recruit's attitude and conduct (e.g. oath of 
secrecy): the opportunity may be taken to impress on him his 
responsibilities. The recruiter must be careful, however, not to 






92 SOE SYLLABUS 


employ this kind of thing on people who would be unfavourably 
impressed by it. 

6. TESTING THE RECRUIT . 

He should be given something harmless to do (e.g. conveying an 
innocent message). This will not only test his reliability but 
will tend to make him feel that he is committed to the 
organization. 

When the man is finally recruited it may be best for the 
recruiter to fade out and an intermediary to be introduced with 
whom the recruit will in future deal.

AGENT MANAGEMENT 

HANDLING 


A. 14. 

November, 1943. 


1. PAYMENT. 


Payment should be put on a business footing from the start. 

Although patriotism is the best motive to seek when recruiting 

agents, it is usually best to pay agents as well (they may need 

it; and it affords an additional means of controlling them). 

a) The 0rgani2er should institute regular salary scales. An Agent 
should not be paid too highly at first as it is bad to reduce 
the amount at a later stage, but useful to be able to increase 
the amount. Payment of a regular salary is a more satisfactory 
method than making irregular payments for services rendered. 
The latter method encourages the making of claims which have 
to be carefully investigated and may lead to disputes. The 
payment of bonuses for especially good work is, however, 
permissible. 

b) The organizer should look after his agents in the same way 
that a good employer looks after his employees. If possible, 
assurances should be given to the agent, when he is recruited, 
of assistance to him or his dependants, in case of illness, 
danger (possibility of organizing escapes), or arrest. 

c) A clear distinction should be drawn between salary and expenses. 
It may be necessary to demand evidence of expenditures but the 
need for security must be borne in mind. If an Agent is 
unwilling to accept a regular salary it may be possible to see 
that he does not lose, by paying him generous expenses. 

d) Payment should always be made punctually and if possible in 
advance. If the organizer is unable to make a promised payment 
he should tell the agent about it quite frankly, and, if 
possible, state when he expects to be able to pay. 

e) The best way of actually making payment is in cash at a 
personal meeting (See Communications). This opportunity may be 
taken to warn the agent of the dangers of spending too freely. 
No receipts to be given. 

f) No financial disputes should be allowed. If any agent claims 
more than seems reasonable, the organizer should talk the matter 
over with him and pay him what he asks on the first occasion but 
should make it quite clear that he will not do so again. 


g) It is sometimes more useful to make payments in kind rather 
than in money. 







94 SOE SYLLABUS 


h) Do not let one man know what another is being paid. 

2. Training . 

Any newly recruited agent should receive a certain amount of 
training, either from the recruiter or through a cut-out. There 
are two main aspects: 

a) Security. 

If the agent is recruited for a particular job he should not 
have to find a new cover story; but he must be instructed in 
the importance of maintaining his cover at all times and of 
having a good reason for everything he does. 

He must be instructed in the other rules of individual 
security, particularly in inconspicuousness, discretion, 
knowledge of Enemy C.E. methods and planning for an emergency. 
He should be encouraged to train himself in taking the usual 
security precautions and to develop his powers of observation 
and memory. He should also be instructed in the security rules 
of the organization. (See Planning an Organization). 

It may be useful to test a new recruit's security as early as 
possible and to check up on it from time to time. 

b) H is Jo b. 

If the Agent is recruited for a particular job he will need 
the training consistent with this job and he will need a 
certain amount of technical instruction, e.g. in sabotage 
methods. It may be necessary to rehearse with him the 
particular method that he is going to use. 

3. PROMOTION . 

On the whole the Organizer will want to select his chief 
subordinates when he is starting to create his organization, 
rather than promote them at a later stage. Questions of promotion 
will, however, arise from time to time and the following points 
should be remembered: 

a) A man should seldom be put in authority over men among whom he 
has worked as an equal. It is better to transfer him to 
another department. 

b) Seniority in cover occupations may have to be taken into 
consideration. 

c) Even the organizer's chief subordinates should be checked from 
time to time from the point of view of security. 






SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 95 


4. DISCIPLINE . 

This will depend, above all, on the personality of the organizer. 

The following points should be noted: 

a) The organizer should impress on each agent the power of the 
organization to protect those who are loyal to it and to 
punish those who betray it. This point should be introduced 
tactfully as a safeguard to the agent's own security. 

b) He should also impress each agent with the efficiency of the 
organization. He can best do this by being efficient himself; 
by being punctual and discreet, by his ability to make 
decisions, and by his reliability in the matter of promises, 
etc. He should always prepare very carefully before 
interviewing an agent, especially early interviews. 

c) Attitude to results . The organizer will show that he expects 
any job to be successfully achieved. He should show confidence 
without minimising dangers and difficulties. He should give 
credit to successful agents but never carry praise too far. In 
the case of unlucky failure, he should show sympathy and 
encouragement. 

d) Attitude to inefficiency . It is important to discover the real 
cause of inefficiency by checking the agent's statements, 
having him watched etc. If the organizer is satisfied that a 
particular agent's inefficiency is due to over-work or nerves, 
he should talk to him frankly, give him a rest and continue to 
pay him. If it is due to stupidity, the organizer may either 
give him an easier job in future or tell him that he is 
suspected by the enemy and must lie low. 

e) Attitude to double crossing . If after checking and testing a 
man it is clear that he is a traitor, the organizer can either 
frighten him or pay him off (both risky) or kill him. The same 
courses are open if a man pretends that he is being 
blackmailed by the enemy. 

The best method, however, is to prevent double crossing taking 
place by stressing the ruthlessness and long arm of the 
organization at an early stage. Although the agent only knows 
a few people that he can betray, his superiors are well aware 
of his activities and can always take vengeance.

APPENDIX 

RECRUITING 


1. INTRODUCTION . 

The strength of the organization depends on the individual, 
whether for undercover work in the field or at the base. 

2. SECURITY . 

We are most vulnerable when we recruit owing to the danger of 
penetration. Therefore the utmost precaution must be taken. 

a) Retain the initiative - people must not be foisted on us. 
Consider what types are needed, then find them - avoid picking 
up people who come readily to hand. 

b) Use of Security Check and individual judgment. 

3. CONSIDERATION OF TYPES NEEDED . 

a) Undercover agents to work into occupied or enemy territory 
singly or to make contact with existing nets. 

b) Semi-Undercover . Operational groups for short term operations, 
e.g. pre-invasion. 

c) P ara - Militar y. 

d) Propaganda . 

e) Radio Operators . 

f) Operators for Neutral Countries . 

g) Home base executives . 

h) Instructors - home or field . 

Natural Cover will often determine selection. Many good men with 
NO cover. 

4. MOTIVES FOR RECRUITMENT . 

People act from a complexity of Motives, therefore consider 
combination of the following: 

a) Patriotism. 

b) Political or Religion. 

c) Love of Adventure. 

d) Need - (in the field) 


















SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 97 


also 

a) Self importance. 

b) Greed. 

c) Fear - Blackmail. 

d) Revenge. 

It is necessary to determine which motive will appeal most to the 
recruit, and subordinate subsidiary motives to the main one. 

5. PROCESS OF RECRUITMENT . 

a) Good rule for security - often has to be broken: Always try to 
find the man for the job, rather than find a job for a man. 
Disregard of this rule allows the enemy to penetrate by 
placing an attractive but vague proposition before you. 
Attention to the rule helps the morale problem in case of the 
man not being employed. 

b) Quality first . 

c) Go slow - hurry may risk other agents or whole organization. 

d) Inspire Confidence . 

i) Nationally - recruit must feel full backing of the 
country. 

ii) Personally - recruit must feel he is dealing with high- 
grade men. 

6. POINTS . 

a) Face the recruit with the least attractive side of the work. 

b) Do not persuade or buy - rather dissuade if in doubt. 

c) Study his character - weaknesses especially important, e.g. 
wine, women or inability to lie. 

d) Give him a face-saving let-out. Therefore it is not wise to 
tell him too much. 

e) Try and get him to work as quickly as possible. 

7. CONCLUSION . 

A chain is as strong as its weakest link. Everything depends on 
the individual. We must have the best for the particular job to 
be done.

ORGANIZATION 

PART I 


1. INTRODUCTION . 

In order that subversive activity may be effective it must be 
organized. The type of organization will depend on the nature of 
the activity, local conditions and the requirements of general 
policy (see Opening Address). This lecture deals with the 
question from the point of view of an agent who is sent to 
organize a new region. 

2. SURVEY OF AREA . 

The organizer's first step must be to survey his area in relation 
to his projected activity. It is essential to carry this out 
before plunging into operations. He should consider the followings 

a) Geographical areas. 

b) Groups (economic, social, political, national, religious, 
subversive). 

c) Opinions - e.g. Anti-Axis feeling, rivalry between groups. 

d) Individuals - especially leading personalities. 

e) Enemy C.E. forces. 

This survey will enable him to decide where and how to organize 
subversive activities - e.g. propaganda is best organized by 
groups; a military organization must be formed on a geographical 
basis; the presence of low morale or strong enemy C.E. may 
preclude any activity in a certain district. 

3. P L A NNI NG. T HE SECTION S . 

The next step is to decide what sections are needed to carry out 
the projected activities. They can be considered under two 
headings - Operational and Support Sections. 

a) Operational might include scane of the following: 

i) Propaganda . For this section an organizer might wish to 
recruit writers, printers, copiers, distributors. 

ii) Passive Resistance and Minor Sabotage . These two 

activities require much the same kind of organization - 
i.e. on a fairly large scale, which may involve the 












SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 99 


formation of cells inside particular targets (see later) 
with the aid of "insiders". 

iii) Major Sabotage . This requires a totally different kind of 
organization - i.e. the formation of small sabotage 
squads, highly trained and well equipped, either local or 
mobile. "Insiders" may also be needed. Engineers are 
obviously very suitable. 

iv) Para-Military Section . For the formation of special para¬ 
military units, or liaison with existing organizations, 
professional soldiers may be needed. 

b) Support might include some of the following: 

i) Internal Communication . Responsible for all 

communications within organization. This will include: 

- Couriers . People who have cover for traveling within a 
specified area, e.g. commercial traveller, engine or 
lorry driver. 

- Boites-aux-lettres . People in charge of places 
frequented by all classes, e.g. shops, kiosks, etc. 
which can be used for depositing letters. 

- Accommodation Addresses . People who receive regularly 
through the post a large correspondence, e.g. business 
men of all types. 

ii) Security Section . Responsible for watching and reporting 
on enemy counter-espionage, procuring papers, passes, etc., 
security of the organization and of individual members. 

iii) Reception Section . Responsible for meeting and looking 
after personnel and supplies from abroad, e.g. farmers, 
peasants and estate owners. Cover for moving about at 
night, flashing torches, etc. must be arranged. 

iv) Storage and Distribution . Responsible for storing goods 
and equipment belonging to the organization and for 
distributing them when required. Ironmongers, builders, 
warehousemen, carpenters, priests and farmers are 
examples of types used in this section according to the 
type of stores to be accommodated. 

Only a few main storage places advisable, supplemented by 
a number of distribution centres; as far as possible these 
should remain unknown even to those who will use them. 

v) Transport . For this purpose men connected with transport 
services, and firms using trucks, vans, etc. are necessary, 
or even farmers with carts. Accumulation of petrol in 
preparation for zero hour may be handled by this department. 













too SOE SYLLABUS 


vi) Finance . Particularly necessary in a large organization, 
e.g. cashiers, bookkeepers and accountants are useful in 
this connection. Responsible for the payment of agents 
and other disbursements. 

vii) Recruiting . It may be necessary if and when the 

organization becomes large to recruit men capable of 
"spotting talent" and themselves doing the recruiting. 

viii) Medical . Doctors and hospitals will become necessary 
especially in the case of para-military activities. 

ix) Emergency Measures . A special section should be 
responsible for hide-outs, safe houses and escape 
facilities, and for accumulating first rate knowledge of 
prisons, routes, etc. 

These sections may comprise a large number of agents or only one 
or two, the main thing is that each should be organized 
separately. 

4. FORMING A NUCLEUS . 

Having decided on what sections he will need, the organizer must 
now recruit a small number of "Staff Officers". These will form 
the nucleus of the organization. They will be in charge of one or 
more of the sections, and will be instrumental in enlarging the 
organization. 

Provided their safety remains unimpaired, the organization will 
be able to survive misfortunes. 

They must not be too many in number because the organizer must 
limit the number of people with whom he is in contact. Therefore, 
in a large organization where there are many sections, one staff 
officer may take charge of several activities and have several 
section leaders under him. 

Most organizers will have a limited mission and will only need to 
set up a small organization; but the same principles apply, and 
the nucleus is always all-important. 

5. PRINCIPLES OF LAY-OUT . 

Before enumerating the principles to be followed in planning the 
lay-out of an organization in order to achieve the maximum 
security, it should be pointed out that there is always a 
conflict between security and efficiency. 

Security is best achieved by the use of water-tight compartments, 
whereas efficiency depends upon close liaison. A balance must be 
struck between the two. As it is always possible to reduce 
security but very difficult to improve it once it is weak, it is 
best to aim at the maximum security from the outset. 









SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 101 


a) Do not make the organization too large. Much work (especially 
passive resistance, minor sabotage and propaganda) can be done 
by people outside the organization at the instigation of its 
members. 

b) The organizer should deal with only 4-6 subordinates, who 
will normally be his "staff officers". 

c) Leaders of groups or sections will normally do their own 
recruiting, but should furnish full details (except names) to 
the organizer for approval. 

d) Each section must have a clearly defined function and stick to 
it. 

e) The organizer must determine the minimum number of contacts 
necessary between sections, and prohibit any others. 

N.B. Over-centralization is to be avoided, as well as too much 
lateral communication. 

f) Individual agents should have the minimum number of contacts 
within the organization 

g) Individual agents should have as little information about the 
organization as possible. 

h) Men must be held in reserve to fill key positions in the event 
of an emergency. 

i) There should be the maximum use of cut-outs (see below). 


102 SOE SYLLABUS 


PART II 


6. gur-gin:s.. ; . 

a) Definition . 

A cut-out, or intermediary, forms the link between two agents 
or between an agent and the outside world. He may know very 
little about the organization and just carry messages, or he 
may be a liaison officer who is able to answer questions and 
take decisions; but the important thing is that he should not 
undertake any other subversive activity. 

b) Reasons for Employment . 

i) It is dangerous for two important agents (particularly 
from different sections of the organization) to be 
noticed together. 

ii) One agent may not want another, with whom he 
communicates, to know him. 

iii) An agent wants a barrier between himself and any 

authorities - e.g. when sending a telegram, making an 
official enquiry, hiring a flat. 

iv) The use of a cut-out prevents, or delays, the transfer of 
suspicion and the linking up of activities. 

N.B, The value of a cut-out must be explained to 
subordinates. It does not show a lack of confidence in 
them. 

c) cover 

i) A cut-out should be able to contact inconspicuously each of 
the two agents between whom he is the link. If they are of 
widely differing positions, his range of contacts must be 
correspondingly wide. Special opportunities are open to men 
who work in one milieu and live in another - e.g. waiters, 
taxi-drivers, postmen - and also to professional men who 
are used to being consulted by members of all classes - 
e.g. priests, lawyers, doctors, bank managers, etc. 


ii) A cut-out should be able to disappear quickly, cutting 
short police enquiries.

ORGANIZATION 

PART III 


1. CELLS . 

For many types of subversive activity - e.g. propaganda, passive 
resistance, etc. - and with all large organizations, it is 
necessary to organize on a basis of cells; this strengthens 
security. 

a) .D e finitio n . 

A cell is a small group working subversively inside some 
existing group of individuals - e.g. factory, party, union, 
group of workers going into Germany. 

b) Expansion. 

i) One of the most important functions of a cell is to 
recruit other cells. Best method is for one member of 
each cell to have the duty of recruiting a man outside 
who will organize another cell. Similarly, another man in 
the new cell will recruit a further cell, and so on. 

ii) As the recruiter in the first cell is the only man to 
have contact with the organizer of the second cell, 
security is maintained to the highest degree. The value 
of this is that in the event of one agent coming under 
suspicion, police will take a long time to trace others, 
and even if part of the organization is discovered it 
does not necessarily reveal the whole. 

iii) An alternative method is by radiation, whereby the 

members of a cell recruit the organizers of more than one 
new cell. Quicker expansion and more direct 
communication, but security reduced. 

iv) Chain system is most suitable for simple activities not 
requiring complicated orders or exact timing - e.g. 
propaganda; radiation system best where speed and co¬ 
ordination are essential - e.g. secret armies. 

c) Control . 

i) Policy must be laid down from the top and carried out 
uniformly throughout the organization. 

ii) No cell is superior to others; orders are simply passed 
on from above. 










104 SOE SYLLABUS 


iii) Field of recruitment for each chain of cells should be 

limited - e.g. one department in a factory - so that each 
group of cells is kept separate from the others and under 
the control of the agent appointed to look after it. 

iv) The organizer should limit the number of cells to be 

formed in each department or group. The cell members will 
be the "shock troops", influencing outsiders to undertake 
subversive action also (cf.A.15, 5. a).) 

d) Internal Working . 

i) Number . A cell should contain only a small number of 
individuals (3 - 8). 

ii) Distribution of Functions . All members carry out the 
activity for which they are recruited. They must also 
collect any useful information and pass it back. They 
must also maintain security; anything suggesting that 
security is menaced - e.g. absence of cell member from 
work - should be reported up and down the cells at once. 

The organizer responsible for the foregoing also 
maintains liaison with the cell above, collates 
information, passes on orders, maintains security. The 
agent who has recruited the organizer of a new cell 
liaises with him. 

N.B. It may be advisable to appoint one man in charge of supplies, 
stores, etc. 

e) Plans for Emergency . 

Plans must be laid in advance for the possibility of a break 
in a chain of cells which would leave some cells isolated. 
Possibilities are: 

i) General directives on the policy to be pursued in that 
eventuality. 

ii) The linking of the last cell in the chain with the 

organizer of the whole chain, thus making it circular. 

iii) Emergency address - e.g. to appear in an advertisement in 
an agreed paper. 

f) Conclusion . 

i) The cell system has obvious disadvantages - viz. 
slowness, inefficiency, remote control. 

ii) Nevertheless, it is the only system of large-scale 
organization that affords the necessary degree of 
security. 







SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 105 


iii) It is particularly suitable for a continuous campaign of 
simple activities - e.g. propaganda, passive resistance, 
minor sabotage, strikes - and also for ground work 
preparatory to an armed revolt. It may also be used for 
penetrating existing organizations and influencing their 
policy and activities. 

2. PREPARATIONS FOR ZERO DAY . 

a) The organizer must plan the lay-out of his organization, not 
only for operations during the present period of the war, but 
also for operations to take place contemporaneously with an 
Allied invasion. 

b) He may organize a special section to deal with this or may 
plan to switch his normal organization over when the time 
comes - or both. 

c) He must arrange for more rapid lines of communication to be 
substituted for the slow methods necessitated by security 
during the first phase. Cut-outs may be eliminated and key men 
put in direct touch with each other. 

d) He must have men in reserve to take over key positions. It is 
always possible that the enemy knows more about his 
organization than he thinks and will leave it until the 
approach of zero day before making a swoop. 

e) He will have to arrange action and recognition signals for use 
on zero day. 

f) He will have to pay particular attention to the collection of 
material - viz. weapons, ammunition and explosives - and 
information about zero day targets. 

3. SECURITY RULES FQR MEMBERS QF THE ORGANIZATION . 

a) Every member must receive training in self-protection and the 
security rules of the organization. 

b) Each member should have a special function and should be 
prohibited from undertaking any other. Danger of over- 
enthusiastic trying to do too much work, or work to which he 
is not suited. 

c) No member must attempt to find out more about the organization 
than he is told. 

d) Every member must know what names are to be used in the 
organization and stick to these. (Christian names are safest 
and are adequate for a small organization; if numbers are 
used, they should not be consecutive.) 






106 SOE SYLLABUS 


e) No member may carry arms unless he is in a situation where he 
can have no cover story. 

f) No member may contact a member of another organization without 
special permission. 

N.B. The dangers of contacting other organizations which may 
have been penetrated by the enemy have already been 
shown. If it is absolutely essential to contact another 
organization, it should be done in the most cautious way 
through a cut-out, and it may be wise to plant a man 
inside it to investigate its security. 

g) Every member must report any suspicious incident immediately, 
e.g. if he himself is followed or if a fellow member fails to 
appear. 

h) Every member must know what to do in case of emergency. 

This involves: 

i) What warning signals will be used; 

ii) What other members he must warn himself; 

iii) Where to go (hide-out, cover story, etc.); 

iv) What contacts and activities he must drop; 

v) How to re-establish contact. 

4. O RGAN I ZER 'S. A C TI O N I N EMERGE N C Y. 

As has been shown, the organizer must prepare plans for an 
emergency as far as possible in advance. If an emergency arises - 
e.g. an agent finds that he is under surveillance, or is arrested 
- the organizer must: 

a) Decided what contacts, plans and places are affected; 

b) Warn the contacts to take their pre-arranged measures; 

c) Postpone or drop any activities that are affected; 

d) Clean up any places that are affected - i.e. destroy or 
conceal material and documents, cease to use R.V.'s; 

e) Possibly send a message to H.Q. in this country; 

f) If an agent has been arrested, find out the reason for his 
arrest and whether he has talked; 

g) Help the arrested agent to escape if it can be done without 
prejudicing the security of the organization. 




SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 107 


A.17. 

September, 1943. 


USE OF PREMISES 

The use of premises brings with it special security problems. 

1. GENERAL . 

a) No H.Q. should be established until organization has been 
organized. 

b) Premises should be used as little as possible at first. Plans 
and records should be kept in organizer's head and agents 
contacted in many different places. 

c) As organization grows use of H.Q. for above purposes will be 
necessary. Organizer may use residence or place of business. 

d) Additional premises may be required - E.g. for storage, 
printing, courier termini, safe houses. 

Recruit owner or occupier of an existing organization rather 
than set up a new establishment and instal new personnel. 

e) Principle of dispersal most important. Too many activities 
concentrated in one place is bad - E.g. do not keep documents 
at a place where agents meet. 

2. CHOOSING PREMISES . 

Choice will depend on the particular country or region. In thinly 
populated country districts there may be opportunities for using 
isolated buildings - E.g. hiking or ski-ing huts. In a densely 
populated country a private house or commercial establishment in 
a town may have to be used. In selecting the latter, the 
following factors should be considered. 

a) Accessibility . It is important that strangers may be able to 
find their way without arousing suspicion by making enquiries 
or by their appearance being out of tune with the district. 

b) Cover . Wherever possible an attempt should be made to utilize an 
existing concern; any new business is very likely to be suspect 
and subject to enquiry. The usual office hours should be kept, 
bills paid normally and genuine business in every way conducted. 

It must fit into the background - E.g. if it is a shop it must 
be of the appropriate class for the district. 

It must provide cover for agents who come to visit it - 
suitable cover both for regular cut-outs and for irregular 
visitors or complete strangers - E.g. from abroad. Visitors 
must have "genuine" reason for coming. 









108 SOE SYLLABUS 


Its cover must be built up. If possible, genuine business 
should be carried on before subversive activity is started. 

c) Facilities . Some attention should be paid to the suitability 
of the premises from a defensive point of view - i.e.: 

- Facilities for concealing persons and articles, E.g. 
thickness of walls. 

- Facilities for escape (alternative exits) 

- Vulnerability to surveillance. 

d) Control of Access . There are three degrees of access available 
in a town: 

- A "general" shop, where it is impossible to prevent the 
entry of police spies. 

- An establishment with individual attention for the clients - 
E.g. tailor, doctor, lodging-house. 

- A private office which is confined to a specific group of 
clients. This creates the maximum of difficulty for police 
infiltration, both because of the need for an adequate story 
and also because of the possibilities offered by waiting- 
rooms. Safes and records may also be kept here. The 
professional man, whose office fulfils these conditions, can 
combine the functions of H.Q. and cut-out, acting as a 
representative of the organizer. 

It will be seen that the degree of security will vary in 
inverse proportion to the facilities for providing cover. 

3. SECURITY PRECAUTIONS . 

As many as possible of the following precautions should be taken 

in connection with any premises, including agent's own place of 

residence. 

a) Agent must always be able to tell whether a room has been 
entered and searched during his absence. The best precaution 
is tidiness. Additional methods - E.g. leaf in keyhole, hair¬ 
pin under door - must not be conspicuous. Possibility of 
leaving trap - E.g. notepaper. 

b) As little incriminating material as possible should be kept on 
the premises. Anything no longer needed should be destroyed - 
E.g. coded writings, carbons. N.B. traces on blotting paper 
and writing blocks. Quantities of arms and explosives should 
be put in special caches. 

c) Hiding places should be prepared. It may be necessary to have 
both permanent and emergency hiding places - the latter only 
to be used if the premises are raided while the incriminating 
articles are in use. 





SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 109 


Fireplaces, and any other places in current fashion with the 
police, should be avoided. In this connection, information 
about any successful police searches is most valuable. 

Permanent hiding places should be difficult of access rather 
than subtle - E.g. - burial. 

Documents should not be concealed in places where bulky 
material might be found - in case they are looking for food, 
for example. 

d) Preparations should be made for destroying incriminating 
evidence which is too dangerous to conceal. 

N.B . Quantities of paper burn very slowly, even when petrol- 
soaked, and ashes may be deciphered unless broken up. 

e) Provision should be made for persons to be concealed or make a 
get-away (alternative exit), and to clear away all traces. 

N.B. Danger of Gestapo's entry from all sides simultaneously. 

f) If cover permits, some one should always be on guard. It may 
be very useful (particularly in case of rooms situated in a 
large block) if some one - E.g. the hall-porter - can be 
enrolled to act as guard, and a warning system of 
communications arranged. 

g) All-clear and danger signs should be pre-arranged - visual 
and/or oral - E.g. object of pre-arranged colour, doormat in 
certain position. Difficulties of black-out. A "normal" sign 
should preferably be used to denote danger. Possibility of 
limiting times for calling and only showing sign then. 

h) A constant watch should be kept to see whether the premises 
are under observation; and when any one enters or leaves, a 
check should be made to see that he is not followed, and, if 
he is, a warning should be arranged - E.g. stick left behind. 

i) It may be wise for frequent visitors to alter their dress 
slightly and arrive by different methods in order to avoid 
attracting attention. 

j) In case one set of premises comes under suspicion, an 
alternative set should be ready, with the necessary cover 
story built up. After change, foster police suspicions of 
first place. 

k) Rents and taxes on premises should be paid promptly to avoid 
enquiries, unless the "cover owner" has never paid them 
promptly before.

COMMUNICATIONS - PERSONAL MEETINGS 


A. G ENERAL 

Advantages : 

(a) More information can be passed. 

(b) Correct emphasis on information can be made. 

(c) Immediate replies can be obtained. 

Disadvantages : 

(a) Meeting may be suspicious. 

(b) Suspicion may be passed on to hitherto unsuspected contact. 

(c) Meeting may be a trap. 

B. METHODS 

Three types of personal meeting are discussed with a view to 

obviating disadvantages: 

1. BETWEEN ACQUAINTED AGEN TS: 

(a) Cover for meeting 

- By chance. (First arrival mustn't show impatience). 

- On purpose. (NO confusion with chance meeting). 

(b) Choice, of meeting-plage 

Bad : Railway stations, public-meetings, hotels, brothels, 
queues (Informers), post-offices. (If you must meet at 
one of these, use danger signs). 

Better ; Small hotels, restaurants, bars, cafes. 

Still better : Street, gardens (exc. France), Catholic 

churches, cemeteries, Turkish or Swimming- 
baths, museums, art-galleries, plages, parks, 
motor-cars, house hired or rented by third 
party, private houses and offices, "hangabout" 
places (cf. woods near Oslo on Sunday!); and 
dance-halls or places of amusement when not 
controlled (cf. no dancing in Norway). 

NOTE: Always have cover for your presence at any meeting place. 

(c) Conversation . 


Cover conversation. Arrange on arrival.

SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 111 


Smile and laugh as much as possible (Permanent tip for 
agent.) 

(d) Passing messages . 

NO tricks, if it is possible to pass message unnoticed, (e.g. 
in W.C. etc.) 

If tricks necessary, take equipment. (Use of identical 
equipment - swapping brief-cases, matchboxes, newspapers, 
etc.) 

Sign to indicate message passed. 

(e) Security Precautions . 

- Innocent pre-visits to R.V. as cover. 

- Security of pre-arrangements (e.g. time and date given 
separately and not by same method such as telephone. 
Communist trick of ADDING one hour to time - therefore, 
police are always late). 

- Safety and danger signs (e.g. NO gloves - danger.) 

- Alternative R.V. in case of accidents. 

- Be punctual (Synchronise watches or pre-arrange that time 
be taken from neighbouring public clock.) 

- Guard against microphones. (Turn on wireless, bath, 
gramophone). 

- Limit the time you are going to wait. 

- Precautions against surveillance. (Meet in black-out where 
practical). 

- Change R.V.'s frequently. 

BETWEEN UNACQUAINTED AGENTS . 

(a) Cover 

- Must be chance meeting. 

(b) Description 

- Proper description (see A.7.) better than combination of 
signs. (Wearing red rose and drinking green drink). Signs 
should be used only as check for description. 








112 SOE SYLLABUS 


(c) Passwords 

- Never conspicuous - i.e. dramatic, incongruous or 
compromising. 

- Therefore generally banale but marked, esp. in reply. 

(Use of pause, gesture, special but commonplace word). 

- Should be short and spoken verbatim. (Easy to forget 
passwords in stress). 

- Should be introduced naturally. (Some passwords are good 
'openers', others have to be introduced gradually.) 

- Reply at once. 

(E.G. One agent used a badly chosen password to a M. Viveau 
staying at a certain hotel. V. looked astonished, and the 
agent later found that there were three men in the hotel 
having the same name.) 


Security Precautions. 

-If you're suspicious, don't go to R.V. 

- Don't accept outsider's suggestions on time, place, date. 

- Send cut-out to R.V. to bring him somewhere else. 

- Intercept him yourself en route, and take him elsewhere. 

- Send man to recce R.V. in advance. 

- Have yourself followed. 

- Extra search of yourself before meeting.

Appendix 
A. 18 

February 1944 


COMMUNICATIONS 

L'Organisateur, a Communist clandestine paper in Belgium, obviously 
destined for members of the Party only, in its July 1943 issue, 
gives a solemn warning that many arrests of Party members have been 
due solely to negligence, to failure to observe the precautions 
necessary to a clandestine movement, and it therefore sets out 
briefly the main rules for Security. 

1. Arranging a meeting . 

No meeting may be entirely arranged in a single letter. First, a 
letter should be sent containing the day of the meeting and the 
time of the meeting, and, if the two other members of the Group 
do not know each other, a sign by which they may recognize each 
other. Then a second letter should be sent, at least one day 
later . containing the meeting place. This elementary rule for 
security must not be neglected under any circumstances, however 
acute the urgency. If one of the Group has something urgent to 
report, he must verbally summon the person to whom he wishes to 
report to some meeting place which can be mentioned in veiled 
terms, as for example, "The place we last saw each other". 

Take care that nothing is written in a note book, and that in no 
case is anything written down in plain language. Always sign 
notes with a number or an initial. 

2. Recognition signs for members of a Group . 

It has been found in practice that if two comrades do not know 
each other, a single recognition sign is not sufficient, and may 
lead to trouble. Therefore, two recognition signs should be 
given. If one of these signs is seme article of clothing, it must 
be given in full detail: for example, a 'brown hat' is not 
sufficient, but adding 'a breast-pocket kerchief of a certain 
colour and design', makes recognition easy. 

For passwords, definite replies must be given. For example, if 
one comrade asks the way, the other should reply, "It is a long 
way", or "It is five kilometres". On no account should ordinary 
replies such as "I am going too" be given. 

3. Use of Railway Stations and Trains . 

Main railway stations or stations in big towns must never be used 
for boarding or leaving trains. Members of the Party should 
always use suburban or small town stations, whether they are 
known or not in the bigger stations. 









114 SOE SYLLABUS 


4. Meeting Places . 

No meetings should be arranged in the vicinity of stations or at 
fixed points. Meetings should be arranged so that one comrade 
meets another during a walk, one having left point 'X' at a 
certain time to walk in the direction of 'Y', and the other 
having left point 'Y' at a certain time to walk in the direction 
of 'X'. In case they fail to meet each other, each one should 
walk the full length and back again to allow the other to catch 
him up, and a final attempt to meet should be made an hour later 
than the fixed time. 

When the two comrades meet, they should greet each other as if it 
was sheer accident, chat for a moment, watching the while to see 
they have not been followed, and should then go off together. 

5. Members of the Party, and above all, messengers , should cease to 
arrange meetings one after the other in the same place, or a few 
steps from the same place. Meeting-places should be at least a 
quarter of an hour's walking from each other, and during this 
period, members should take care that they are not followed. 


6. When a Party member meets another 


Should one party member meet another by accident, in the street, 
for example, he should make no attempt to speak to him, or even 
recognise him. It has become known that one person, who had never 
taken part in any anti-German activities, has been arrested, and 
is still in custody, simply for shaking hands with an old friend 
whom the Gestapo were following. If members have no Party reason 
for meeting, they should ignore each other, and leave until 
tomorrow any gossip they may wish to pass on. 

7. Each Group Leader is held responsible for seeing that these 
Security rules are observed.

COMMUNICATIONS - INTERNAL 


1. INTRODUCTION . 

Organizers must be able to keep in constant touch with 
colleagues. It will be found that better work is obtained if all 
subordinates feel that means of communication are assured. 

It must be remembered that in communicating an agent endangers 
himself and friends. Therefore greatest care is essential. 

It is necessary to study the wide choice of methods available, 
adopting the most suitable method to the circumstances. 

2. POST . 

Much the simplest way for persons at a distance to communicate 
with one another, but slow, uncertain and fairly easily 
investigated by police. In occupied territories letters 
frequently censored, especially in and out of prohibited areas. 
Letters of suspected persons sure to be opened; thus consider the 
following measures: 

a) Essential to use code (veiled language) or secret inks. 

b) If suspected, do not use post for subversive correspondence. 

c) Avoid putting precise address at letter-head, except where 
regulations demand it. If unavoidable, existing address (e.g. 
real hotel, innocent address, third part, Quisling) is 
preferable to an invented one. 

d) Avoid watermarked paper and typewriters of non-standard makes 
or which have recognizable peculiarities. Only use your 
typewriter for secret work. Hide it when not in use. 

e) Sign with Christian name or nickname. 

f) Avoid special classes of mail (air, registered, parcel post). 
Make use of postcards and business mail, particularly 
circulars. 

g) Post at different post-boxes and at places away from place of 
residence. Remember sender's letters can be identified if 
sender is followed (e.g. newspaper thrown into post-box after 
letter). Therefore take precautions against surveillance. 

h) When sending instructions by post, allow for delay in delivery 
owing to war-time conditions. 

i) Greater security is afforded by accommodation address, 







116 SOE SYLLABUS 


especially if it gives cover for the reception of numerous 
letters, where organizer has no such cover; conceals your 
address and identity from your correspondent. Letters must be 
sent as if to accommodator; no enclosures and passed on by 
hand or post according to purpose of accommodation address. 
Special outside markings useful to show that letter contains 
secret message. Change accommodation address frequently. Only 
use for two correspondents at most. Avoid post restante - such 
mail is watched; only use when no other address available. 

3. BOITES-AUX-LETTRES . 

These are places where persons or their cut-outs can leave and 
collect messages. A useful means of communicating between 
principals who do not wish to meet. Very difficult for the police 
to trace one party by surveillance of the other. 

They must afford cover for frequent visits, e.g. tobacconist, 
cafe, newspaper kiosk, etc. 

Remember: 

a) Intermediary must be recruited but need not be informed of the 
nature of the organization. 

b) Correspondents should hand in letters clandestinely, or have 
cover for leaving them openly. Study ways of handing over 
messages, e.g. in newspaper, in food, with the change, etc. 

c) Decoy letter and/or alternative cover (e.g. black market) 
should be available in case of emergency. 

d) There should be danger signs in case of emergency. 

e) Clear box regularly. 


4. "DEAD” BOITES-AUX-LETTRES . 

Same as above, but without living agency, e.g. milestones, 
lavatories, etc. Here again principals can communicate without 
meeting. 

Note: 

a) There is no risk from intermediary. 

b) There would be no warning in the event of discovery, in 
which case the place would be watched by C.E. 

c) Have cover story for "finding" message, e.g. find by 
accident. 

d) Police might watch correspondence without principal 
knowing. 




SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 117 


5. COURIERS ■ 

A courier supplies means of circumventing censorship by having 
messages carried by hand or verbally. Slow but surer than other 
methods. Message can be destroyed in emergency. On the other 
hand, if courier should be captured and interrogated, there may 
be imminent personal danger to several organizers. Precautions: 

a) Courier must have good cover and know route well. 

b) Message is best memorised, but if this is not possible it 
should be written on paper easy to destroy and/or 
conceal, e.g. silk paper, rice paper, cigarette paper. In 
such circumstances 

c) Courier should not know contents or code. 

d) Courier should be instructed in the principles of body 
searches and snap control. Courier should not have direct 
contact with principals. 

e) Relay system of short-stage couriers connected through 
boites-aux-lettres has advantages. Each courier knows 
stage intimately and should not exceed his stage. 

6. "DEAD^-COIffilERS. 

Messages can be concealed on vehicles or in luggage of unknown 
persons. Same conditions as in case of "dead" boites-aux-lettres. 

7. TELEGRAMS . 

An easy and quick method of sending short messages between 
persons at a distance, but very conspicuous and certain to be 
censored, and of limited use only - to be used sparingly. Sender 
will almost certainly have to identify himself. Two permanent 
records of contents. Telegrams a good means of indicating the 
whereabouts of the sender, arranging rendezvous and answering 
questions. 

Precautions: 

a) Code with good cover must be used. 

b) Use cut-out to transmit wire as his own. 

c) Make sure recipient socially qualified to receive 
telegrams. 

d) Accommodation address (see Post). 

8. TELEPHONE . 


Very quick method for those at a distance to communicate, but 
always assume that telephone conversations cure censored. 






118 SOE SYLLABUS 


Conversation of suspected people often recorded automatically. 

Therefore use public call-boxes. Trunk callers may have to 
identify themselves - serious limitations on trunk calls may 
exist. 

Use of foreign languages generally forbidden but careful code 
must be used, and conventional conversation. Suspicious 
phraseology likely to be noted. 

Telephone can best be used for arranging rendezvous, answering 
questions, etc. 

9. ADVERTISEMENTS . 

A means of communicating reasonably quickly with a large number 
of people simultaneously. Could be used either as a sign or to 
conceal coded message. Impossible to identify recipients. Best 
used as general warning or action sign. Remember: 

a) Identity of inserter must usually be established. 
Possible to use cut-out. 

b) Wording must be normal as it is likely to be carefully 
scrutinised by C.E. 

c) Good cover for inserting essential. Articles lost 
preferable to "for sale" or "goods required" notices. 

d) Regular insertions must be made by regular advertisers. 

e) Delay. 

10. GENERAL PRECAUTIO NS- 

a) Messages can often be sent in two parts, either part 
alone being incomprehensible, e.g. the main message by 
courier, the key by post. 

b) There should always be at least two means of 
communication between important organizers working 
together, in case one is "blown". 

c) Important messages should be sent in duplicate. 

d) May be necessary to arrange for acknowledgement of 
messages. 

e) Avoid numbering of messages. 




SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 119 


A.20. 

September. 1943. 

COMMUNICATIONS - EXTERNAL 


1. GENERAL. 

Communications between agent in field and base are vital and 
require careful organization. Several alternative routes are 
advisable in case one is "blown". The following are the principal 
methods: 

a) W/T . Short, urgent messages and/or where immediate reply 
is required. 

b) Courier Service . For long messages, urgent and/or less 
urgent; maps, material, etc. 

c) "Innocent" Letter . Sent to address in neutral country. 
Short messages for use when agent is out of touch with 
members of his organization. 

Other possible methods are: 

d) Telephone or telegram to neutral country. 

e) Advertisement in press. 

f) Diplomatic bag. 

g) Carrier pigeons. 

2. W/T . 

This is the only method for rapid communication and for obtaining 
immediate reply. The more it is used the more likely it is to be 
detected. Operator is highly trained man with special cover. To 
protect him and/or his activity, the following precautions are 
required: 

a) He should not be used for other work. 

b) Other agents should not go to his residence or place of 
operation. It is even better if they do not contact him 
direct. 

c) A reserve means of communication with him must be 
maintained if he has to go into hiding. 

d) Only messages which cannot be sent conveniently by other 
routes should go by W/T. 

e) Messages must be between 150 and 400 letters. 






120 SOE SYLLABUS 


3. SECURITY DEVICES OF OPERATOR . 

a) Set disguised as suitcase. 

b) Bury set on arrival. 

c) Aerial made of local wire, camouflaged. 

d) Must have cover which allows absence at irregular times. 
Routine job useless unless employer in organization. 

e) Should live with friends as key-taps audible. Residence 
must supply hiding place. 

f) Should constantly move set and/or aerial. 

g) Times and length of transmission restricted according to 
plan. 

4. COURIER SERVICE . 

A series of linked relays by which messages and/or material are 
carried. There may be several "termini", each linked with a 
"branch service" or "main service". It is much slower than W/T, 
but usually safer. In general, couriers cover each stage. 

The following points should be noted: 

a) Each courier should have special knowledge of his relay 
and good cover for travelling regularly. 

b) Several couriers can be employed on each stage so that 
there is a frequent service. Often courier will make 
journey innocently. 

c) Couriers' contact with one another and principals should 
be through boites-aux-lettres where possible. 

5. DIFFICULTIES AT FRONTIER OR SEA . 

Special problem arises at a crossing of frontier or sea. The 
following methods are used: 

a) Smugglers, attendants on trains, lorry drivers, etc. used 
as couriers. 

b) Trains, cars, other vehicles, used as "dead" couriers. 

c) Material floated down rivers or thrown over frontier line 
in containers, e.g. "turnips". 

d) Drum taps and puffs of smoke, etc. 

e) Neutral seamen as couriers. 





SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 121 


f) Materials smuggled out to submarines, seaplanes, fishing- 
boats , etc. 

g) Material concealed on ships or aeroplanes, etc. by dock or 
aerodrome workers, etc. 

6. LETTER SENT TO ADDRESS IN NEUTRAL COUNTRY . 

Safe, but slow method. Letter can contain: 

a) Long message in secret writing. 

b) Short message in code. 

c) Pre-arranged signal, e.g. warning, "all well", etc. 

d) Agent's address when he is out of touch with the rest of 
his organization. This is the commonest use. 

Precautions . 

i) Addressee does not know purport of letter but believes 
himself intermediary between innocent person in 
occupied territory who wishes to write to friends in 
allied territory and cannot communicate direct. Much 
innocent correspondence, in fact, passes this way. 

ii) Sender must take every precaution against censorship 
which is stricter for foreign letters than for 
internal, e.g. choice of address, danger of registered 
letters, air mail, length of letter, etc. 

iii) Not too many letters must be sent to the same neutral 
address. 

iv) It is more important to conceal identity of sender 
than recipient, who runs little danger. 

7. TELEPHONE . 

Telephone messages to and from neutral countries are sometimes 
permitted. Formal application must be made. Use of language 
restricted. Censorship certain. Therefore good cover essential. 

Use of code highly dangerous except between experts. In general 
only suitable for arranging rendezvous, giving address, etc. 


8. TELEGRAMS. 


Same considerations apply as to telephones - see previous 
lecture. Telegrams are useful for indicating address of sender. 

9. ADVERTISEMENT IN PRESS . 

Enemy papers available in this country within a week. First-class 
cover required for frequent insertions. See previous lecture. 







122 SOE SYLLABUS 


10. CARRIER PIGEONS . 

Rarely used except for notifying safe arrival. Special 
instruction essential. 

a) Advantage . Can take small maps, drawings, etc. quicker 
than by other methods, except W/T. 

b) Limitations . 

i) Difficulties of importing and hiding. 

ii) Difficulties of feeding and exercising. 

iii) Loss of homing instinct after a time. 

iv) Limitation to distance and direction which can be 
flown. 

v) Pigeons cannot "hone" in darkness or in fog.

A.20 .a 
February 1944. 


THE W/T OPERATOR 

1. IMPORTANCE OF THE W/T OPERATOR . 

a) He is the only member of the organization who can maintain 
quick and reliable communication with your base. 

b) He is a specialist with lengthy training. 

c) The supply of W/T Operators is strictly limited. 

d) A constant objective for enemy C.E. 

2. THE W/T OPERATO R AT W QRK . 

a) Sets . 

There are several types used. 

Size - Not greater than 2'0" x l'O" x 6", excluding battery. 
Weight - Not greater than 40 lbs. 

Camouflage - Suitcases, gramophones. 

b) Aerials . 

Similar to the ones used for ordinary receiving sets. For 
transmitting, aerials must be more carefully located than for 
receiving. 

E.g. - On high ground away from trees, steel structures, 
overhead power lines and electric power stations. 

c) Power. 

There are two sources of power: 
i) Electric Mains . 

The consumption of electricity will be registered on a 
meter. The operators will therefore have to tap mains 
before they enter the meter. 

ii) Batteries . 

Provision must be made for recharging. 

d) Plan . 

Before leaving the operator receives a complete "plan" 
containing scheds, call signs, etc. This plan is a very secret 
document, even more important than the set. The operator must 
work in accordance with the "plan" and any alterations must be 
sanctioned by the base. 












124 SOE SYLLABUS 


e) Messages . 

The operator must be off the air as long as possible and on 
the air for the shortest time possible. Therefore, messages 
must be SHORT and CONCISE, eliminating all superfluous words. 

f) Codes . 

Encoding and decoding should, if possible, be left to 
organizers and W/T operator should only be required to 
transmit and receive the messages as they reach him. In some 
cases he may have to do the encoding and decoding. 

3. ENEMY C,E. M E T HOD S FOP D ET ECTING U J.EGAI, TRANSMITTING. 

The enemy's organization for detecting illegal wireless 
transmitting is efficient and scientific. Any or all of the 
following methods are used. 

a) Ban on private transmitters. 

b) Informant Service reporting suspicious events and behaviour. 

c) Snap controls to detect if sets are being moved from place to 
place. 

d) Search of localities where illegal transmitters are believed 
to be operating. 

e) Interception service which records suspicious messages and 
attempts to break down the ciphers. 

f) Use of the following D.F. (Direction Finding) Equipment: 

i) Fixed D.F. stations to locate the approximate area of the 
transmitter. These are numerous. 

ii) Numerous mobile D.F. stations to localise the whereabouts 
of the transmitter. 

- work in pairs or threes. 

- Camouflaged as ordinary vehicles with non-metal bodies. 
E.g. - Delivery vans, ambulances, laundry vans. 

iii) Hand-carried D.F. apparatus for use in places which 
cannot be reached by car. 

iv) Slow flying aircraft which cruise around over suspected 
area and may fly low over the station. 

v) Electric supply cut off street by street in the suspected 
locality. 

An illegal transmitter is easiest pinpointed in country 
districts, but D.F. apparatus is most numerous in the 





SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 125 


towns. Suburbs are therefore generally agreed to be the 
safest places. 

4. W/T OPERATOR PRECAUTIONS . 

The operator must continually protect himself against enemy C.E. 
and should remember the following points. 

a) Cover - for being absent from his work when transmitting and 
visiting stations. 

b) Alternative Sets - if possible located in different locations 
and used at different times on different days. 

c) Alternative Places - to which he can move his set whenever 
opportunity offers and as often as possible. 

d) Friends - to warn him of the approach of mobile D.F. 
stations and help him move his set. He should not transport 
it himself. Wireless sets are more easily replaced than 
operators. 

e) Observation Point - from which to observe the approach of D.F. 
cars while he is operating. 

f) Security - Plan and other suspicious material should be 
concealed somewhere apart from the set. Copies of messages 
should only be kept if absolutely necessary. Pistol should be 
kept with the set. 

g) Transmission - Operator must be on the air for as short a time 
as possible. Messages must be short and explicit. 

h) Power - To counteract cutting off of electricity battery 
should be available to enable the transmission to continue. 

5. RELATIONS BETWEEN ORGANIZER AND W/ T OPERATOR . 

Organizer must do everything possible to protect the W/T operator 
and the organization from the consequences of suspicion falling 
on him. 

The W/T operator must be capable of looking after himself and not 
expect the organizer to do everything for him. 

The relationship should be governed by the following 
considerations: 

a) Direct contact between the organizer and operator should be 
cut to a minimum. Communication should be through "Boites-aux- 
lettres" or "cut-outs" rather than personal meetings. 


b) The organizer may have to help the operator find spare parts 
for his set, arrange repairs, obtain suitable locations, etc. 













126 SOE SYLLABUS 


c) The organizer should tell the operator as little as possible 
about the organization, only sufficient to enable him to do 
his job. 

d) Only really urgent messages should be given to the W/T 
operator; the organizer should always have a second line of 
communication. 

e) The organizer can either encode and decode messages himself or 
give them to the W/T operator to do. 

f) The organizer and W/T operator will each number their own 
personal messages. 

g) Usual emergency arrangements must be made for the W/T 
operator. E.g. - Line of escape, address in neutral country 
for communication. 

6. RELATION BETWEEN W/T OPERATOR AND OTHER MEMBERS OF ORGANIZATION. 

a) As few members of the organization should be known to the 
operator as possible, and of those he should not know their 
real names or addresses. 

b) Communication between him and them should be by "Boites-aux- 
lettres" or "cut-outs". 

c) He should know as little as possible of their activities. 

d) The W/T operator should recruit his own assistants. 

E.g. - To transport his set, warn him against D.F. cars. 

7. ARREST OF W/T OPERATORS . 

a) If caught a W/T operator may not be executed, but "persuaded" 
to reveal his secrets so that he can be "played back". The 
enemy's "persuasion" is difficult to resist. He must therefore 
arrange "security checks" beforehand, so that recipients will 
know that messages are being sent under pressure. 

b) The organizer must also advise the base at once if he believes 
the W/T operator has been caught and is being "played back".

PASSIVE RESISTANCE 


1. HISTORY . 

a) During the years 1940-41 the Nazis were supreme in Europe. 

b) The people of Europe, ridden by years of propaganda and Fifth 
Columnism, were apparently powerless. 

c) Britain was holding on by the skin of her teeth, daily 
expecting invasion, suffering losses at sea, and unable to 
give assistance to occupied countries. 

The U.S.A. was still neutral. 

d) The people of Europe, deserted and betrayed by their own people, 
their Allies with their backs to the wall, were disillusioned. 

In some cases this disillusionment took the form of acting hate 
of Britain, which was encouraged by the conquering Hun. 

e) There was, however, still a weapon left to fight the Hun, 
which if co-ordinated and organized could be extremely 
powerful. This weapon was that of Passive Resistance. 

f) This was recognized by Britain and long-range plans were made 
to co-ordinate and organize the spasmodic outbursts of Passive 
Resistance which soon began to appear in occupied countries. 

2. DEFINITI ON _ OF PASSIVE R E SIS TANCE. 

Passive Resistance consists of acts which depend for their 
feasibility and value upon being; 

a) Non-technical - acts which can be done by anyone. 

b) Non-risky - either because they are indetectable or because 
the resisters have perfect cover. 

c) Unlikely to have unpleasant consequences for the civilian 
population. 

d) Capable of being carried out by large numbers of people. 

An organized passive resistance campaign can be compared to an 
attack on a man by hundreds of mosquitoes, each giving him only a 
tiny sting but all together eventually driving him away. 

3. OBJECTIVES . 

The main objectives of a Passive Resistance Campaign should be: 
a) The obstruction of enemy production. 







128 SOE SYLLABUS 


b) The obstruction of administration. 

(For examples - See Appendix "A") 

4. TARGETS . 

The following weaknesses of the enemy should be borne in mind: 

a) Personnel - shortage and bad quality. 

b) Home-sickness of enemy personnel and anxiety about their 
people at home. 

c) Character of the enemy - i.e. vanity, self-consciousness and 
lack of humour. 

5. OR GANI ZA T ION QF PAS SI VE R ES ISTANCE . 

a) Organization and direction are essential if acts of Passive 
Resistance are to be effective. 

b) Directives may be received from the base from time to time but 
in their absence organizers should use their own discretion 
and their own special knowledge. Directives on Passive 
Resistance are often very effective as coming from outside the 
country. E.g. - "V" Campaign, "Go slow". This is not the case 
with directives on sabotage where risks are greater. 

c) The propagandist makes the most effective organizer. 

d) The cell system can be used for organizing a campaign as close 
organization is not necessary. 

e) Specialization in particular acts of Passive Resistance is 
sometimes valuable but organizers must be prepared for 
elaborate checking by the enemy. 

f) Incentives should be devised to maintain enthusiasm. 

E.g. - So many wasted minutes each day represents over a 
period the sinking of a U-boat. 

6. EFFECT OF PASSIVE RESISTANCE ON THE CIVILIAN POPULATION . 

A passive resistance campaign organized amongst a civilian 

population, 

a) Gives them something to do - from feeling themselves useless 
and hopeless they come to the realization that each and every 
person can, in his own way, fight the enemy. 

b) From simple acts of passive resistance they acquire confidence 
to go one step further, namely towards acts of simple 
sabotage, and from there to greater sabotage and even 
guerrilla warfare. 

c) The combined effect of a), and b). raises their morale and 
encourages united efforts against the enemy and prepares them 
for possible unpleasant reprisals.

EXAMPLES; 


1. OBSTRUCTION OF PRODUCTION . 


a) Under cover of feigning stupidity, ignorance, over-caution or 
fear of being suspected of active sabotage, factory workers 
can obstruct by: 

i) Demanding written orders, 

ii) Asking unnecessary questions, 

iii) Making too frequent checks, in order to avoid being 
accused of sabotage, 

iv) Rejecting everything not perfect, 

v) Working too well, but slowly, 

vi) Specifying too high quality, 

vii) Obeying rules implicitly regardless of consequences, 
e.g. - reading all addresses when sorting packages, 

viii) Misunderstanding orders, e.g. - misdirecting trucks. 


b) Under cover of feigning exhaustion by air-raid or under¬ 
nourishment, they can cause delay by: 


i) Slightly increasing accident rate, 

ii) Ca'Canny. 

iii) Slightly inefficient work, 

iv) Not correcting errors of others. 


c) Under cover of complaints about ersatz they can increase the 
consumption of materials and general wear and tear. 


d) Further trouble can be caused without serious risk by: 

i) Constantly making "reasonable" complaints, 

ii) Non-cooperation with salvage schemes, 

iii) Not passing on knowledge to unskilled workmen, 

iv) Giving lengthy and incomprehensible explanations when 
questioned. 


2. OBSTRUCTION OF ADMINISTRATION . 


Under cover of feigning stupidity, ignorance, over-caution, over¬ 
enthusiasm, over-politeness, the layman can obstruct 
administration by: 

a) Misunderstanding regulations. 

b) Filling up forms incorrectly. 


c) Making unnecessary enquiries.

ii) Unexploded bombs. 

iii) German personnel buried in debris of building, 

iv) Allied parachute landings, 

v) Allied personnel in Axis uniforms,

- Sufficiently detailed to merit investigation. 

- Borne out, if possible, by the corroborative evidence 
of others - stories should not be suspiciously similar. 

They are best reported second-hand, but if not the reporter 
must have cover explanation for having obtained his 
information.

SUBVERSION OF TROOPS. 

1. The essential difference between an Armed Force and a group of 
civilians is DISCIPLINE. Solvent of discipline is SELF-INTEREST. 

2. influences provoking self-interest among Enemy Occupying Troops are: 

a) Dissatisfaction. 

b) Anxiety. 

c) Terror. 

d) Loneliness. 

e) Deprivation. 

(Note: Terror can be resolved by fight, flight or concealment; 
anxiety cannot.) 

3. Stimuli to provoke these influences are selected by campaign- 
planners from enemy-troop morale-reports and are disseminated 
orally and graphically by agents, using: 

a) A hostile approach : Effective, but sometimes unsafe. 

b) A sympathetic approach : Effective and generally safer. 

4. Some stimuli known to have provoked above-mentioned influences 
among German troops in Occupied Europe: 

a) DIS SATISFACTION . 

i) Internal feuds between:

ii) Irregular Pay. 

b) ANXIETY . 

i) Allied bombing of soldiers' families. 

- Cover for source of news. 

ii) Jealously over behaviour of wife or girl-friend at home.

lines of attack are open: 

- Sib. that SS-men at home have free and condoned 
intercourse with German girls. 









132 SOE SYLLABUS 


- Reminder that there are 2,000,000 foreign PW's and 
6,000,000 Foreign Workers in Germany - from many of 
whom German girls are none too safe.

SELECTION AND APPRECIATION OF TARGETS. 


1. SELECTION . 

a) Two main categories of target: 

- Long-term. Attackable at any time or all the time. 

(E.g. enemy morale, railroad-transport.) 

- Short-term. Attackable only at a "zero-hour" signal 
(E.g. European second-front targets.) 

b) Organizer should compile priority-list of each. 

Choice conditioned by: 

- Pre-selection of targets by superior H.Q. 

- Organizer to use initiative within general directives. 

c) We need only be concerned with alternative 2. b). in whose 
case selection of targets will be governed by: 

- C o nfo rmi ty,. with _g ener . 9l . d i re c t jy eg. 

Allied Strategy may demand attacks now on transport, now on 
food, now on man-power, not on morale, now on industry, etc. 

- Importance, to...enemy. 

Information from H.Q. or own Informant Service on 
bottlenecks, key-personnel, etc. 

- Vul nerability . 

- Resource? available - 

Co-operation of guerrillas. Allied air-forces. State of 
supplies and own man-power. 

- E f f e ct__pn_l oc a l_po p u I a t i o n ■ 

- Direct: Lack of food, electricity, etc. as result of 
operations. 

- Indirect: Hostages, reprisals. 

- Timing. 

Synchronisation with other attacks. 

2. INTELLIGENCE . 

Prelude to all operations is good information. This can be 
acquired by three methods. 


a) Regular Intelligence Service. 













134 SOE SYLLABUS 


b) Informant Service. 

c) Personal Reconnaissance. 

It is from your informant service that you will receive information 
regarding the target to be attacked and the inside knowledge 
necessary, E.g. industrial information from factory workers, etc. 

The Organizer should, himself, recce the target, or detail 
responsible subordinates, and check information received from 
other sources, to enable him to draw up detailed plans. 

3. INFORMATION REQUIRED . 

It is essential when planning an attack to decide what you 
require to know about the target. Failure to recognize one 
essential item will mean failure of operation. 

Information on most of the following points will be required: 

a) Risk to security of organization? Can sabotage look like accident? 
Line of retreat? Assess worst consequences of detection. 

b) Guards - are they alert? Can they be bluffed or bribed? Police 
or Military - Operation Orders. 

c) Walls, fences, etc. - Can they be surmounted by ladders, wire 
clippers, etc.? 

d) Entrances - Are they well protected? 

e) Surrounding ground - Does it afford cover? 

f) Phases of moon - When will nights be dark? 

g) Weather - Will bad weather be helpful? 

h) Feast days - Will they reduce efficiency of security measures? 

i) Day - When is sabotage likely to be most effective? 

j) Time - What time of day is most favourable? 

k) Visitors - What sorts of people visit premises? 

l) Passes - Can they be forged, stolen or borrowed? 

m) Recruitment of employees - Can agents be infiltrated? 

n) Reliability of employees - Are they susceptible to subversion? 

o) Most normal types of errors and accidents in factory - Can 
they be reproduced artificially? 

p) Bottle-necks - At what point will damage do most harm? 



SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 135 


q) Possibilities of fire, flood, etc.? 

r) Land-marks, facilities for guiding aircraft - Can such be 
created or found? 

s) Available resources - Can assistance be brought from base? 
Students can suggest other factors. 

4. APPRECIATION OF METHOD OF ATTACK . 

From the above information, an appreciation of best method of 
attack can be drawn up as follows: 

a) Object . "To put target out of action." 

b) Factors to be considered . These will correspond to the answers 
to questions asked under Para 2). above, E.g. 

i) Security - attack can look like accident only if in form 
of fire. 

ii) Guards extremely efficient, 

iii) Walls, fences, impregnable, 

iv) Entrances strongly protected. 

v) No cover in neighbourhood - grounds swept by searchlights, 

vi) Slackness on feast days unlikely. 

c) Cpgrses Open . 

In attacking a target one of the following alternatives will 
be used: 

i) Passive resistance, with, or without, outside advice. 

ii) Minor sabotage with, or without, outside advice and supplies. 

iii) Major sabotage, by inside workers, with, or without, 
outside supplies and/or help. 

iv) Major sabotage by outsiders, with, or without, inside 
assistance. 

v) Air bombing or sea attack. 

Seme of these methods can usually be excluded at once. 

Consider each of the others in relation to factors. Then state 
course selected, with reasons. 

d) Plan . 

Here plan for carrying out method selected should be briefly 
stated. It should be the logical outcome of the previous 
argument.

OPERATIONAL ORDERS 


1. OPERATIONAL ORDERS . 

Vital to issue orders accurately and securely, therefore draw up 
your plans and orders under definite headings, thus: 

Information. 

Intention. 

Method. 

Administration. 

Inter-communication. 

Memorise this framework, adherence to this simple form will prevent 
omissions in passing on orders to subordinates. 

Necessary to consider these heading in detail. 

a) Information. 

i) Relative to target . All available information obtained, 
each operator receives that which directly concerns his 
share in the operation. Sketch plan if necessary, but 
destroy immediately. 

ii) Relative to own forces . No more than essential for each man 
to carry out his share in the operation. As an 
encouragement possible to indicate that substantial forces 
being used, E.g. if co-operation being received from 
outside, operators should know. 

b) intention* 

Each operator receives concise statement of intention of 
operation in so far as it concerns his actions and his morale. 
For security reasons do not give more than minimum information 
about object of whole operation - may be necessary, however, 
to indicated this in general terms so that the operator 
appreciates importance of operation, e.g. total effect of 
passive resistance when operation, E.g. total effect of 
passive resistance when carried out by all employees in a 
department. 

c) Method . 

Here detailed instructions must be given to each operator (or 
party) separately of what he is to do and how he will do it, 
for the period of operation. 

The following points should be considered: 











SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 137 


i) Sabotage weapons - fire, water, drought, sand, passive 
resistance, hammers, mishandling instruments or 
explosives. Explosives only as last resort. 

ii) Sabotage to appear an accident? 

iii) Circumvention of security measures at target, 

iv) Approach to target. 

v) Retreat from target. 

vi) Arms, type, method to be used? 

vii) Day, time, duration. 

d) Administrative Arrangements . 

Here deal with general organization, pay particular attention 
to periods before and after operation - the following will 
have to be included: 

i) Cover story for each operator - either open or 
clandestine, not a mixture. 

ii) Identity of leaders or contacts (if necessary). 

iii) Supplies of arms, explosives, money, food and clothes, 
how and where to be obtained. 

iv) Treatment of casualties (if overt operation, casualties 
may have to be ignored, if clandestine they may have to 
be concealed). 

v) Transport, if any. 

vi) Passes. 

vii) Clothes search before operation. 

viii) Synchronisation of watches. 

ix) Dispersal arrangements, after operation complete. 

e) Inter-communication . 

Before, during and after an operation, inter-communication 
between operators (or parties) taking part most important. 
Consider, therefore, the following: 

i) Password(s) or recognition signal. 

ii) Action signal. 

iii) Cancellation signal. 




138 SOE SYLLABUS 


iv) General warning. 

v) Individual danger signal. 

vi) Other means of communication. 

vii) Location of leader(s) during operation. 

2. GENERAL SECURITY . 

Necessary to preserve utmost security throughout, therefore 
organizer and leaders must observe following, and pass on when 
necessary: 

i) Issue orders as late as possible. 

ii) Avoid writing down orders, etc. 

iii) Give orders to each operator (or party) separately as 
far as possible. 

iv) Do not tell anyone more than he needs to know for the 
operation. 

v) Zero hour to be withheld until last minute. 

vi) Warn operators that plans may have to be cancelled at 
last minute without assigning reason. 

vii) Ask for questions after orders have been given and have 
verbal orders repeated back. 

viii) Warning not to meet more than necessary after operation, 
and avoid showing satisfaction at success.

FINAL ARRANGEMENTS 

(Throughout this lecture students will be asked to make suggestions 
about important points and articles which might be useful.) 

1. INTRODUCTION . 

Throughout the period prior to departure you should go over the 
details of your story and your papers to become thoroughly 
conversant with each. 


Sometime before your departure make sure that you will take with 
you everything that you will require and that there will be 
nothing which will not accord with your cover story. 


It is necessary to carry out checks in the following order: 


2. BODY . 

Examine your person carefully. 

a) Does cut of hair, moustache, beard, conform to cover story? 

b) Does condition of hands, nails, feet, conform to cover story? 
E.g. manual workers have horny hands; the feet of people who 
have walked long distances show it. 

c) Remove nicotine stains from fingers. 


3. CLOTHES . 

Check carefully: 

a) Cut and quality - do they conform to cover story? 

b) Are they reasonably worn in? 

c) Replace unsuitable labels and remove washing marks. 

N.B . Tailor's markings to be avoided but clothes of foreign 
origin not necessarily suspicious, much foreign clothing being 
imported before the war into territories now occupied. 

d) Footwear - particularly trade marks, etc. Do not overlook 
repairs, e.g. rubber heels, etc. Remember that shoes worn by 
people having walked long distances show it. 


4. EFFECTS . 

Examine all effects which you wish to take with you, e.g. watch, 
rings, note-case, brush, comb, fountain pen, pencil, cigarettes, 








140 SOE SYLLABUS 


cigarette case, cigars and cigar case, tobacco, tobacco pouch, 
letters, photographs, etc. Leave behind those which are of 
unsuitable manufacture or incongruous. It is conspicuous to have no 
effects, so replace them in so far as may be possible with suitable 
articles, e.g. those purchased in places where you are supposed to 
have been - souvenirs, letters bearing out your story, etc. 

5. HABITS . 


Check your personal habits and get others to consider them. Are 
they conspicuous? Do they accord with your cover story? E.g. 
table manners, way of dressing, handwriting, etc. 

6. PAPERS . 


These will be perfectly forged, it not genuine; you should make 
sure that the details are correct, E.g. age, description, place 
of birth, visas, etc. 

7. EQUIPMENT ■ 

Check over what equipment you will require. Consider the 
following: 


Map - is it of the sort that you might obtain 
use in the country to which you are going, or 
destroyed once its immediate purpose has been 


or be able to 
should it be 
served? 


b) Compass and torch - where were they made? Can you retain them, 
and for how long? 


c) First-aid kit, water bottle, flask - is it wise to retain 
these after you have landed? 


d) Spade and sacking. These must be thrown away immediately after 
the parachute equipment has been buried. Make sure that you 
have material such as sacking on which to place the earth when 
digging the hole. 


e) Suit-case. This should be of common appearance for the country 
to which you are going. Outstanding colour or pattern would be 
conspicuous. 


f) Money. Make sure that it is of the kind current, E.g. silver 
coins may have been withdrawn from circulation. Useful to have 
sufficiency of small change. Notes of large denomination may 
attract attention, and where can they best be changed? 


g) Food. If this does not conform to the country of your 
destination it must be eaten before you leave the 'plane or 
left in the 'plane. 

h) Any necessary accessories, as may be required according to the 
projected operation or circumstances. 





SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 141 


8. WEAPONS. 


a) Do you need a gun? It is generally only helpful when you are 
engaged in activity for which there can be no cover story, 

E.g. landing by parachute. At other times it is likely to be 
an embarrassment. If you take one, decide what to do with it 
after landing. 

b) Other weapons are less suspicious or conspicuous but sometimes 
equally helpful, e.g. knuckle dusters, loaded sticks, 
truncheons, etc. 

9. DRUGS . 

Decide whether you will require any of the following: 

a) L. Tablets. 

b) K.O. Drops. 

c) Benzedrine. 

d) E. Capsules. 

e) Ptomaine Tablets, etc., etc. 

10. FINAL CHECK . 

Draw up list of all points and requirements so as to be sure that 

nothing is forgotten at the moment of departure. Carry out second 

check a few hours before you leave. 

a) Body re-check - do not have excessive hair grease. 

b) Clothes re-check - brush out pockets, avoid small pieces of 
tobacco, etc. Be sure shoes are clean. 

c) Effects re-check - search clothes carefully so that articles 
have not been overlooked, E.g. bus tickets, coins, matches, etc. 
Has anything slipped through the holes in the lining of pockets? 

d) Papers, equipment, weapons, drugs - check all over again; be 
sure that nothing has been overlooked.

ARRIVAL AND FIRST DAYS 


1. ARRIVAL . 

An agent may proceed to his country of destination either openly 
or covertly. 

a) Openly . 

Important part of cover story so don't prejudice it. Perfect 
papers and reason for journey are implied. Comply with 
regulations (immigration controls, customs, etc.) and do not 
attempt to take compromising material through these 
controls. It can more safely be supplied later. 

b) Cover tl y■ 

i) By parachute. Carry out drill as instructed. 

ii) By sea. Check position. Methods of concealing or 

destroying boat. Beware of mines, booby traps, patrols. 
Move inland by night (prohibited area). 

iii) By land. Survey frontier beforehand. Memorize 
landmarks. N.B. danger of recrossing frontier. 
Discretion in using services of guide (agent 
provocateur). Proceed at least 20 kilometres beyond the 
frontier or to a point beyond the nearest town and then 
turn back into the town thus appearing to come from the 
interior. Note: Controls for coastal and frontier areas 
may be some distance into the interior - not 
necessarily on the coastline or at the frontier. 

2. FIRST STEPS . 

a) Movement■ 

May need to cover considerable distances. In general it is 
better to move by day except in prohibited areas. If stopped 
by day it is a routine matter; by night it may lead to 
serious interrogation. 

Tips: 

i) Don't move in groups of more than two. 

ii) At night all cars, motor-cycles and bicycles are 
potentially dangerous (facilities granted only to 
Germans or collaborators). Therefore always hide in 
this emergency. 

iii) Times to move: beware curfew and dusk hour; best to 
move at rush hours; special care on market days. 










SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 143 


iv) Avoid long-distance trains and try to break up 

journey. N.B. If cover permits, travel First Class. 
Small country stations inadvisable as stranger is 
conspicuous. Care at large termini and junction 
stations for regular controls. Possibility of 
alternative exits. 

v) Do something definite during day, particularly when 
in towns. Don't hang about. 

vi) Lie low if Allied 'plane shot down or any 

disturbance (escape, shooting, parachute scare) 
exists in the vicinity. 

vii) Where possible avoid carrying parcels or suitcases 
except when they are demanded by your cover. 

b) C o yer Sto r y - 

i) Explanation of present and recent movements and 
activities essential (especially while moving from 
landing point to nearest town). 

ii) Necessary to have arrived from somewhere else. 
Therefore check the details, E.g. train times, 
contained in your explanation as soon as possible. 

iii) Clothes, state of shoes, etc. must not belie this 
cover story. 

c) Facing Officials.. 

In early days avoid contact with officials whenever 
possible. If meeting face to face with an official, better 
to approach with a question than to "run away". 

d) Obtaining Information . 

Seek information unobtrusively all the time re regulations 
and conditions. Watch particularly for signs of an unusual 
situation, E.g. state of alert, special controls in force 
due to disturbances, etc. 

3. RECEPTION BY FRIENDS . 

a) If met by reception committee, many initial difficulties 
disappear. 

b) If not met but supplied with a contact address, make this 
contact as soon as possible (will give cover, information, 
possible job, etc.). 

i) When contacting a stranger, do not rely only on name 
and address. Use a description and if possible a 
password. 






144 SOE SYLLABUS 


ii) Check to see that information re contact is up-to-date, 
E.g. still at address, not under surveillance or 
"blown". 

iii) Prepare cover story for visit. It possible make it part 
of your general cover. If you don't know the man, do 
not pretend you do. 

iv) Choose time for contact carefully - beware of revealing 
yourself to other members of family, servants or 
children, except within your cover. 

v) Always beware of contacting your relatives, 

particularly your parents, except when they are likely 
recruits. 

vi) Don't take messages in any circumstances. 

4. WHERE TO S . TAY . 

Agent may have to take temporary residence. Choice of place is 
primarily determined by his cover. Following possibilities should 
be examined: 

a) Hotel . 

Advantages: crowd, moving population, inconspicuous, gives 
freedom of movement. Disadvantages: usually watched, danger 
of informers. "International" hotel is not suitable for 
protracted stay but smaller hotel may be if cover permits. 

b) Pension. 

Less easily watched by the Police. The disadvantage is lack 
of freedom of movement and curiosity, gossipings, etc. of 
boarders. If thoroughly reliable pension-keeper is known, 
this could be used. 

c) Lodging . 

Difficult to find and stranger is conspicuous. Land-lady may 
be curious and report to the Police. If lodging is taken, try 
to win land-lady's sympathies early by some plausible story. 

d) Paving Guest . 

Difficult to arrange for temporary residence but is possible 
for permanent purposes provided the family is unsuspected. 
They may have to be in the know. 

e) Villa (e.g. France or Belgium). 

Good for permanent residence; independent, away from 
outsiders. Better not to live alone; best cover is a woman. 






SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 145 


f) Ch a r i tabl e . I ns titu ti on s. 

For seamen, etc., but considerable danger of mass arrest. 

g) Brothels . 

Not considered suitable except in real emergency. Danger of 
informers and police supervision. 

h) Prosti tute -with flat. 

Possible in emergency and certainly better than brothel. 
Dangerous type, as they can easily be bought and are police 
informers. 

5. E&amp;BLy_DMS. 

a) Lie low and undertake no subversive activity. 

b) Build up your cover - job, recent history. Let your actions 
constantly create cover. 

c) Check up on documents and C.E. controls. 

d) Look for permanent residence. 

e) Check landing grounds if given instructions on this point. 

f) Make arrangements for communication with W/T operator or 
other member of organization already on the spot. 

g) Begin survey of area. 

All the above will involve obtaining information by use of 
personal reconnaissance and the informant service that must be 
established from the outset.

SELECTION OF DROPPING 

POINTS AND RECEPTION 

ARRANGEMENTS 

1. INTRODUCTION . 

An organisation, or an individual member of one, may have to call 
for outside assistance for the successful carrying out of an act 
of sabotage. Personnel or stores, or both, may be called for and 
in order to ensure the safe arrival of this help, which will be 
sent by air, the greatest care must be taken ins 

a) The selection of the Dropping Points - that is, the spot 
where the stores are to be dropped; and 

b) The arrangements made for the reception of this help on the 
ground. 

Dropping operations will be carried out in bright moonlight at 
approximately 500 feet, with the aircraft flying at 100-120 miles 
per hour. 

2. DRQPPlNG_paiNTg. 

First of all the following general principles, relative to the 
size and selection of a Dropping Point, must be borne in mind: 

a) An open space not less than 600 yards square, unless it is 
anticipated that several containers and/or men will be 
dropped, in which case it should be at least 800 yards 
square. 

By taking this area the ground would be suitable for any 
wind direction. 

Avoid agricultural ground: 

i) Injury, especially to ankle, 
ii) Evidence in the form of tracks, damaged crops, etc. 

Avoid swamps. 

Grass parkland is ideal for personnel, but for containers 
most types of ground will be found suitable. 

Cover should be available in the vicinity for the 
concealment of personnel or equipment, but an area 
completely surrounded by tall trees should be avoided since 
there is danger of parachute becoming caught in them. 

b) There should be no H.T. or telegraph wires in the vicinity. 







SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 147 


c) There should be no clumps of trees in the middle of the 
Dropping Point. Further for an aircraft to be able to see 
the light from 500 feet the latter should be at least 500 
yards from 100 foot trees. 

d) If possible, there should be at least one "safe house" 
within a mile, but not nearer than a mile, for security 
reasons. 

e) Allowance must be made for "wind drift". It is estimated 
that there is a 60 yards' drift for every 5 miles per hour 
increase in the velocity of the wind. This is estimated for 
a 'plane flying at the height and speed previously 
mentioned. No dropping operation should take place if the 
wind speed is over 20 miles per hour. 

3. SELECTION ■ 

First stage . There are three main considerations: 

a) Safety of the aircraft dropping the stores. 

b) The D/p's selected must be easy to recognise at night. 

c) Arrangements for reception on the ground must be 
considered down to the smallest detail. 

a) t&lt;? ensure the Sa fety of tb? car rying A ircraft 

The following main principles should be taken into account: 

i) The point should not be near a heavily defended area; a 
low flying aircraft immediately becomes vulnerable to 
light flak. 

Direct lines of approach to such areas should also be 
avoided to eliminate danger from night fighters. 

Vicinity of enemy aerodromes is highly dangerous and must 
be avoided for obvious reasons. 

ii) Selected areas should be as level as possible and 

although high, mountainous and hilly country should be 
avoided, since navigation is difficult, a level plateau 
giving the dimensions required can be used. 

Valleys are unsuitable unless several miles wide. 

If a valley is used, it must be very long and wide for 
big aircraft, as -these gather speed slowly. Thus the 
aircraft would have to go from 100 m.p.h. to 160 m.p.h. 
to climb, and this would take several miles if the 
undercarriage is down. Rising ground and hills should be 
ten miles away for night dropping (i.e. hills more than 
1,000 ft. above dropping point). 





148 SOE SYLLABUS 


iii) The dropping operation must be completed and the 'plane 
clear of enemy occupied territory during the hours of 
darkness, so consideration must be given to the distance 
the site is from the base. 

b) The Points Selected Must be Easy to Recognise at Night . 

Ease of recognition at night is of paramount importance and 
upon this depends the whole success of the operation. The 
following aids and indications to quick recognition will be of 
the greatest assistance to the pilot for guiding him on the 
D/P for they can be plainly seen in the moonlight from 2,000 
feet, at which height he will begin checking up his position. 

i) Coast-line . If possible with breaking surf, as this is 
easily distinguishable. River mouths over 50 yards wide 
and sharp promontories jutting out into the sea, and 
inlets are also good guides. 

ii) Rivers and Canals . Both give moon reflection which will 
prove a helpful indication. Wooded banks reduce the 
reflection very considerably, but generally speaking the 
width of a river used for indication should be not less 
than 30 yards wide. Canals need not be so wide as this 
for they may be easily picked up by their straightness. 

Danger of confusion if more than one river. Best to have 
one solitary river. 

Small streams are no good whatsoever. 

(The Germans, flying at 6,000 to 7,000 feet, followed 
the line of the Thames from Oxford on their nightly 
raids on London.) 

iii) Large Lakes - not less than half a mile square. Here, 

too, light reflection is the indication. Small ponds are 
quite useless. Care required if two or more lakes of 
same size. 

iv) Forest and Woodland . To be of any use as a guide these 
should have clearly defined boundaries or be of 
unmistakable shape and at least half a mile square. Note 
age of map in case of recent falling. 

Irregular patches of woodland are useless. 

v) Straight Roads . Stretches of main road, straight for at 
least one mile, and especially one or more intersecting, 
give quite a good indication; more so when the road is 
wet. A series of puddles along the length of a road have 
been found to be of considerable use. Crooked and 
winding roads and minor roads are practically useless. 

vi) Railways . Of little use except during the winter months 









SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 149 


when there is snow on the ground when a main line cuts 
out a black ribbon running through the white landscape. 


vii) Towns . If subject to black-out, towns are of 
unless fairly large, say 20,000 inhabitants, 
possibility of a town larger than this being 
defended must not be overlooked.

It is apparent, then, that expanses of water are the 
best indication for quick recognition in darkness, and 
that small features, such as churches, water-towers, 
villages, etc. are of no use whatsoever. 


The ideal is to have a combination of features, and in 
this case a railway may be quite a valuable indication. 


It is important to remember that the final point of 
indication should not be more than three kilometres from 
the actual D/P 


The D/P itself will be marked by a system of ground 
lighting which will be more fully explained. (Here 
explain present operational system.) 

gacgn.d_g.tage. 

it is essential that the air point of view must take precedence 
in site selection for it is the pilot who has to locate the 
dropping point. 

This "bird's eye view" is best given by the study of a map. It is 
important that the site be selected first of all from the map and 
then checked for suitability by personal reconnaissance. Several 
points should be chosen, perhaps as many as twenty or thirty. 

A large-scale map will give much of the information desired: 

a) Contours, from which can be calculated gradients. 

b) Nature of ground, marsh, woodland, heathland, etc. 

c) Extent of possible sites. 

d) Houses in the vicinity. 

e) High tension wire. 

f) Expanses of water, rivers, canals, etc. 

In fact, it will straight away give you all the important 
features which can be used as indications for ease of 
recognition and much information relative to actual suitability. 

As soon as it can be foreseen in which area any particular 
agent will be working, a number of points will be selected from 




150 SOE SYLLABUS 


maps/air photographs which appear suitable as D/P's for 
supplies or/personnel. Agent will then on his arrival recce 
these points for suitability and report. 

These points will be given a code reference consisting of the 
first three letters of the code name allotted to the agent, 
followed by a number. 

These points will be studied and memorised by the agent before 
departure. 

If all points chosen before departure are unsuitable, the agent 
will continue his recce until he does find suitable points, and 
then advise H.Q. of their exact location. 

In reporting D/P location, conventional map reference will be 
used: (27's and 13's only: explain Michelin map reference system). 

c) Reception Arrangements . 

The operation must be carried out in fairly bright moonlight 
and the period suitable for dropping is limited to five or 
six days on either side of the full moon. Certain D/P's, 
especially if inside 20 miles of the coastline, may be used 
for longer periods during the month. 

The organisation should study on what nights the reception 
committee can stand by, and in view of uncertainties at least 
five consecutive nights are advisable, but whichever five nights 
are chosen the reception ccrrmittee must be there on all five. 

When help is called for. Headquarters should be given 
approximately fourteen days' grace in which to make their 
arrangements. 

The reception committee is responsible for the disposal of any 
containers. 

Six men may conveniently handle a container, but it is not 
necessary to provide that number per container if the men 
understand their job. Each member of the party should be 
equipped with gloves as carrying becomes painful owing to 
thinness of handles. 

If there is a deep lake or river near the D/P, the container 
may be conveniently disposed of there. 

If it is to be buried a suitable burying point should have 
been chosen beforehand, and if possible holes dug. 

Always remember disposal of outer container must be permanent. 

In order to ease carrying of cells, a strap or rope may be 
used to string them on a man's back. In this way one man can 
carry one cell without much difficulty or fatigue.

THE NAZI PARTY AND ITS 

ORGANISATIONS 


1. GENERAL 

A German newspaper account of any official function nearly always 
includes the phrase "representative of Party, state and Wehrmacht 
were present", these being the three main bodies in Germany which 
exercise authority and maintain armed organisations, namely: 

Party - Nazi party and its Organisations. 

State - the German Police Organisation. 

Wehrmacht - the German Armed Forces. 

Each of these three bodies is directly responsible to Hitler. 


The main principle of Nazi rule is the Fuhrerprinzip or "Leader 
Principle". On this principle the leader has the right to govern, 
administer or decree, subject to no control and responsible only 
to his own conscience. It applies in the first instance to 
Hitler, Leader of the Party, and in a lesser degree to all other 
Party Leaders; for them it is modified in so far as a lower 
leader is responsible to a higher. 

The Leader Principle, introduced into Germany and developed there 
by Hitler and his immediate associates, gives them the right to 
almost anything. Since, however, so few people cannot administer 
a state of, at present, 80 million inhabitants, they need a 
numerous and well-organised Administrative "Followership". This 
Administrative "Followership" is the Party. 

The Party is and will remain a minority of the German people; it 
consists of between 4 and 6 million members. Membership was 
closed in 1933, soon after Hitler's advent to power. Since then 
except for more prominent individuals specially desired, 
membership is open only to young Germans graduating up from 
Hitler Youth. (Party Member - Parteigenosse or Pg.) 

Function of the Party is to be political soldiers, i.e. to 
maintain and spread Nazi ideology and Nazi behaviour throughout 
German population and to see that the activities of the ordinary 
German, both private and professional, are run on Nazi lines; 
furthermore, to control the State organisation so that it becomes 
and remains National-Socialist. 

The task is carried out by: 

(a) The Reichsleitung or Party Cabinet, consisting of 23 members. 








152 SOE SYLLABUS 


(b) The Order of Political Leaders (politischer Fuhrerorden), 
which comprises all party members who hold some office in the 
Party administration. 

(c) The Formations (Gliederungen) - semi-militarised bodies run 
by the Party. 

(d) Affiliated Organisations (angeschlossene Verbande) - massed 
formations whose leaders are supplied by the Party from 
suitable Party members. They are intended to cover all trade 
and professional associations. 

Note : The Party proper, the formations and the affiliated 

organisations together are called "Die Bewogung" (The 
Movement). The Movement comprises the whole of the German 
people. 

3. R EICHSLEITUNG 

The administration of the Party. Shaping and formation of its 
policy are carried out by Reichs-leadership (Reichsleitung) which 
has numerous departments for the various aspects of Party's work 
and interests, e.g. press, schooling, propaganda, etc. 

4. O R DE R QF P OLITI CA L L EADE RS. 

This covers all Germany geographically and penetrates down to 
each German individual. The territorial organisation is as 
follows: 

a. Gau . Approximates to a province. 42 of them covering whole of 
Reich. Chief of each is a Gauleiter who is responsible for all 
Party activity in his Gau, excluding the formations. There is 
also an administrative board (Gauleitung) similar to, though 
smaller than, the Reichsleitung. 

b. Kreis . Each Gau is subdivided into districts (Kreise) each 
managed by a Kreisleiter and an administrative board 
(Kreisleitung). There are over 822 Kreise in Germany. 

c. Ortsqruppe . Each Kreis is subdivided into local groups 

(Ortsgruppen), each controlling a medium-sized town or suburb 
of a large town. Managed by an Ortsgruppenleiter and an 
administrative board (Ortsgruppenleitung). There are over 
28,000 in Germany (c.f. - v.s. ward). 

d. Zelle . Each Ortsgruppe is subdivided into numbers of cells 
(Zellen), each controlling a parish and managed by a 
Zellenleiter, who, unlike the officials mentioned above, is 
not a full-time paid official and has no administrative 
apparatus apart from three minor officials. There are 93,000 
Zellen in Germany (Parish). 


e. Block . Each Zelle is divided into Blocks, each controlling 

approx. 40 households and managed by a Blockwalter who is also 








SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 153 


a part-time political worker. There are about 482,000 Blocks 
in Germany. 

Blocks are sometimes divided into several house-groups 
(Hausgruppen), each controlling 8 to 15 households. There is 
no official title for the Party member in charge of a 
Hausgruppe. 

Functions _o_f _ th e JlQckwalter. 

i) To act as a sort of "political priest" to the 40 or 50 
houses under his charge, ensuring that their thinking and 
their behaviour are on Nazi lines. 

ii) Seeing that they all vote at elections. 

iii) Reporting any misdemeanour of a political nature. 

iv) Reporting monthly on anything he thinks important in the 
attitude of the population, e.g. grumbling at new 
regulations, injustices in the social order, waxing and 
waning of enthusiasm for the regime, etc, etc. These monthly 
reports are sent in by all Blockwalter throughout the Reich 
to their Zellen where they are consolidated and go upwards 
to the Ortsgruppen etc., until the Party leadership has a 
complete picture of the sentiments of the population. 

Thus the Party leadership: 

a. Keeps its fingers on the pulse of the German people. 

b. Has a most useful spy net-work to ensure its fidelity. 

c. Gives work to a great number of bureaucrats, so that a 
considerable and influential section of the population has a 
direct personal interest in the maintenance of the regime. 

Uniform of Political Leaders is brown tunic and riding-breeches 
worn over brown shirt with black riding-boots. It differentiates 
from the S.A. uniform by: 

a. Black tie instead of brown. 

b. Flat military-style cap with a brown velvet band round it as 
opposed to the S.A. kepi. 

c. Ortsgruppenleiter upwards wear golden belts. 

Occupied Territories . This organisation has only been introduced 
into occupied territories which have been incorporated into the 
Reich proper. In districts which the Nazis intend to keep 
permanently without incorporating them into the Reich proper, a 
slightly modified Party organisation for Germans is being built 
up. Quisling governments of occupied countries are trying to copy 
the German system in their own countries - e.g. Norway. 





154 SOE SYLLABUS 


5. FORMATIONS OF THE PARTY . 

The formations have been developed by the Party for particular 
purposes - mostly military or semi-military ones. Their 
leadership and finances are closely connected with those of the 
Party. Apart from a large proportion of Party members, they 
contain a few million other Germans. 


a. Sturmabteilung. (S.A. or Brown-shirts) 

The highest leader of the S.A. is Hitler himself. His deputy 
for the S.A. is Chief of Staff of the S.A. It is organised into 
groups (Gruppen). As a rule each party covers a Gau. The groups 
are divided into Brigades (Brigaden), these into Regiments 
(Standarten), these into Battalions (Sturmbann), these into 
companies (Sturm) etc. Origin of this body was a number of 
young ruffians whom Rohm organised for Hitler in the early days 
of the movement to protect Party meetings from Communist 
interruptions and to break up Communist meetings, etc. 

After Party-Army crisis of June, 1934, S.A. only supplied the 
background on all Party occasions, but since January, 1939, it 
has been entrusted with the task of giving pre and post¬ 
military training. 

Membership in the S.A. can be obtained quite easily. Except for 
highest ranks, staffs and one or two administrative N.C.O's in 
every unit down to Sturmbann, service is part-time; members earn 
their living during the day and wear uniforms and do training in 
spare time. Down to the rank of Standartenfuhrer, S.A. leaders 
are employed on a full-time basis and a minority of junior S.A. 
officers earmarked for further promotion are also serving in the 
same way. Membership amounts to about 3 million. 

Since outbreak of war, majority of S.A. have been called up 
for military service. Those who remain guard P/W camps, etc. 

Uniform . Brown breeches; brown tie; black or brown riding 
boots; brown kepi-type hat with coloured band indicating 
district of origin; sometimes a brown tunic. They carry a 
decorative dagger usually no other weapons. 

Occupied Territories . S.A units of ordinary pattern have been 
formed in all territories which now officially form part of 
Germany proper. In those territories which are now getting the 
amended special form of Party organisation (Poland, etc.) S.A. 
units are also set up. Nothing has been reported up to now 
about the formation of S.A. units in countries the occupation 
of which is only supposed to have been temporary. On the other 
hand, Hirdmen in Norway and N.S.B. men in Holland are local 
equivalent of the S.A. in Germany. 

b. N.S.K.K. (National-^ 


This formation has been entrusted with the "motorisation" of 







SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 155 


the German people; also with the pre- and post-military 
training of Germans who desire to service or have served in 
the motorised branches of the Army. The only difference in 
organisation between the N.S.K.K. and S.A. is that the 
Sturmbann of the N.S.K.K. is called Staffel and the supreme 
leader Korpsfuhrer. 

Uniform . Same as S.A., except that black breeches are worn 
instead of brown; black F.S. caps with N.S.K.K. eagle on side; 
brown tunic with N.S.K.K. badges. Sometimes a brown kepi-type 
hat like that of the S.A. is worn instead of the F.S. cap. The 
N.S.K.K. kepi always has a black band and, instead of the 
ordinary eagle, the special N.S.K.K. eagle is worn on it. 

Note: N.S.K.K. have been seen in: 

i) Tunics of army pattern with brown N.S.K.K. collars and 
black F.S. caps with N.S.K.K. eagle on side of cap as well 
as on the upper left sleeve. 

ii) Blue Luftwaffe uniforms but with N.S.K.K. badges. 

Occupied Territories . Since war, N.S.K.K. have been taken over 
in bulk, together with their leaders (not individually as in 
the case of the S.A.) and are used very widely wherever the 
German army makes its appearance. Besides doing technical 
transport work, they are partly used as messengers, dispatch 
riders, and sometimes even as traffic policemen. 

Belgium and Holland appear to be the only occupied countries 
in which non-German people have been recruited into the 
N.S.K.K. 


c. M AM.-dH^tip n^l-Sezgo l ist i sches . Flifigej. Kgres).. 

Was formed from the D.L.S. Verbande in 1939. Is controlled by 
German Air Ministry but organised like the other formations. 
It gives pre- and post-aviation training. Close co-operation 
between the N.S.F.K. and air units of the H.J. 

Uniform . Same cut as S.A. with brown shirt, but breeches, 
tunic and cap (beret) are air-force blue. 

Qcgup ied Territories . Not employed. 

d. SS (Schutzstaffel or Black Guards ) . 

Originally formed as the elite of S.A., i.e. higher standards 
for height and physical fitness; also for "political 
reliability". Since Hitler's advent to power, have been 
split into professional and part-time sections. Have great 
prestige and authority as elite of Nazi movement. 


Head of SS is Heinrich Himmler - Reichfuhrer SS.

ii) SS Verfugungstrupp e (SS auxiliary troops). 


Full-time organisation serving for 4 years but belonging 
neither to police nor army; in fact a sort of private 
army whose primary function is to ensure internal 
security. Young Germans due for military service can, if 
desired and if physically and politically suitable, 
volunteer for the SS. Serve for 4 years instead of 2. 
They are organised into 4 regiments. 

SS Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler (Hitler's Bodyguard) 

SS Standarte Deutschland. 

SS Standarte Der Fuhrer. 

SS Standarte Germania. 


They have their own artillery, recce units, transport and 
supporting arms. They undergo full military training and 
are equipped as motorised forces. Besides being used in 
peace-time as a "show" guard on high state occasions, 
they were garrisoned so that in the event of civil 
dissensions they could act quickly. 

iii) ToteDk opfverbaQde (Death's Head Units). 

Formed as concentration camp guards; completely 
militarised; service is for 12 years. 

Since outbreak of war, special SS Divisions have been formed 
from the Verfugungstruppe and the Totenkopfverbande. These 
divisions, which are all motorised, are known as the "Waffen 
SS". They are: 

i. SS Division Adolf Hitler (motorised), 

ii. SS Division Das Reich (motorised), 

iii. SS Totenkopf Division (motorised). 

iv. SS Ritter Brigade (cavalry). 

v. SS Viking Division (motorised; Norwegian, Danish, 

Finnish, Belgian, Dutch volunteers with German 
strengthening). 

vi. SS Polizei Division (not motorised; recruited from 
the Schutzpoli 2 ei and the Allgemeine SS). 

Since the outbreak of war, many new specialist units including 





SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 157 


A.A., Alpine troops etc. have been set up within the framework 
of the Armed SS. In all, there appear to be 9 divisions of SS. 

Uniform - Peace . Black uniform (breeches, tunic and military 
cap) over brown shirt; this is to-day worn by non-militarised 
SS. Death's head is worn on centre of the cap. On right collar 
patch the SS sign is worn and on left collar patch the 
wearer's rank. A band worn round left cuff will give number of 
company or name of regiment. 

Uniform - War . On active service the SS Divisions wear the 
field-grey uniform of the German army except: 

i. The Hohheitsabzeichen is not worn on right breast but on 
upper left sleeve. 

ii. Collar patches are black with SS insignia, 

iii. Shoulder straps carry ordinary army badges of rank. 

Occupied Territories 

i. Besides fighting as elite front-line troops, the SS are 
called upon if troubles arise or are met with in occupied 
territories. They co-operate with the Verfugungspolizei. 

ii. German SS men in black uniforms will be seen here and 

there in occupied territories. They will probably be high 
SS officers attached to German administrative services or 
high police officials in their peace-time uniform. Waffen 
SS have been known to wear their black uniform off duty. 

iii. SS organisations have been set up in some occupied 

territories. Among them are both Allgemeine and Waffen 
SS. Among the latter are the Norwegian Regiment 
"Nordland", the Dutch Regiment "Westland" and the Danish, 
Dutch and Flemish Kreikorps as well as some Finnish 
units. Among the former are the Allgemeine SS in Norway, 
the Netherlands and the Schut Scharen Vlaanderens. The 
German press now uses frequently the term "Germanische 
SS" to indicate that these SS units do not serve their 
respective Quisling governments but in the first place 
Germany - a fact which is also stressed by the oath of 
allegiance which they swear to Hitler. 

Hitler Jugend (H.J,) 

Every German child, male or female, must join the Hitler Youth 
at the age of 10. The official organisation for boys is called 
the Deutsches Jungvolk and that for girls the Deutsches 
Jungmadel. 

At the age of 14 the children are transferred to the H.J. 
proper or the B.D.M. (Bund Deutscher Madchen). The H.J. is 
organised on a regional basis within the Reich. A Gebiet 
(usually covering one Gau) is divided into Banne (usually one 
or two to every Kreis). The Banne are divided into about ten 







158 SOE SYLLABUS 


Stamme (450 boys per Stamm). These are divided into lower 
formations, the lowest being a Rotte (3-5 boys). They do semi- 
military training and learn National-Socialist doctrine. 

Through this organisation the Germans control the juvenile 
labour in Germany. 

Bannfuhrer upwards (H.J. leaders) are employed full-time. 

Hitler Youth is divided into H.J. ordinary, naval, motorised, 
cavalry and flying. 

The girls stay in the B.D.M. up to the age of 21. 

At 18 the boys leave the H.J. and go into the Labour Service. 

f. Reichsarbeitsdienst (R.A.D). 

Consists of 6 months' training prior to military service, 
military discipline and weapon training; largely engaged on 
land reclamation etc. Since the war they are found in occupied 
countries building aerodromes etc. R.A.D. building battalions 
are also used in close connection with the fighting units of 
the Army and Air Force. 

Uniform - Working . Light grey overalls. 

Uniform - Walking-Out . Dark khaki uniform with jacket cut 
similar to officer's tunic. 

Red armlet carrying a swastika worn on left arm. 

The building battalions wear steel helmets with the Army or 
Air force eagle. 

6. AFFILIATED ORGANISATIONS 

They are intended to represent all public and private activities, 
thus replacing all organisations, political or non-political, 
which existed before 1933. All the important and most of the 
unimportant jobs in them are held by Party members. Each 
affiliated organisation is controlled by a department of the 
Party organisation. E.g. all teachers are organised in the N.S. 
Lehrerbund, all workers in the Deutsche Arbeitsfront etc, etc. 
Membership is not compulsory but a man would not find work unless 
he was a member of one of the organisations. 

7. T H g . GER M&amp;N'S-P-BQGBESS 

The progression of a German from his childhood is therefore 
through the following bodies which govern his activity and shape 
his thinking; 

a) Jungvolk from 10-14 years. 






SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 159 


b) Hitler Juaend from 14-18 years. 

c) Arbeitsdienst from six months before military service. 

d) Military Service for 2 years (or 4 years in the SS). 

e) Professional Organisation during his working hours. 

f) S.A.. SS, N.S.K.K. or N.S.F.K . during his spare time. 

Much care is being taken about schooling Germany's future Nazi 
leaders. Specially selected boys are sent to schools where they 
are given the ordinary education with a good deal of raciology, 
politics and military training added to it. (Adolf Hitler-Schulen 
and Nationalpolitische Erziehung-sanstalten; the latter always 
and the former more recently supervised by a high SS officer.) 

If a boy has shown great promise up to the time of leaving 
school, labour service and military service, he will, after a 
short time in the lower spheres of the Party organisation, be 
sent to a "Schulungsburg" of the Party to be trained to become a 
higher leader. 

In this way, the Nazis control the German population and, through 
the Hitler Schools, hope that they have laid the foundation of 
the continuance of Nazi rule in Germany. 

That the Nazi system is not only rather new but also rather 
unnatural, and is certainly not the result of anything innate in 
the German people, is shown by the safeguards that the Party 
leaders have had to devise for it. For example, they have founded 
the most powerful and all-embracing police and spy organisation 
the world has ever known. This organisation could not, of course, 
be kept outside politics; it could not function as a detached 
(and professional) State authority. It has, as we shall see in 
our study of the German police organisation, to be brought into 
the closest contact with the organisations of the Party.

ORGANISATION OF GERMAN POLICE 

SERVICES 


INTRODUCTION. 

There are four Police and Security Services which are dangerous to 
our agents: 


1. German Civil Police. 

2. National Police of student's own country. 

3. German Intelligence Service. 

4. German Military Police. 


GENERAL 

It is clear from our study of the Nazi Party that the conception of 
the Nazi-controlled state is base on a very simple principle - i.e. 
the maintenance of the authority of a dictator who has supreme power 
and is responsible to no one but himself by: 

1. ruthless elimination of all political opponents. 

2. ensuring that all actions and thoughts of citizens both 
in their professional and private lives accord with Nazi 
doctrine. 

With the police force of the traditional democratic set-up, 
competence and outlook, this cannot be achieved. 

HISTORICAL SUMMARY. 

Under the Weimar Republic each State had its own uniformed police 
force. In addition, there existed everywhere a special police force 
called the "Politische Polizei", a branch of the Kriminalpolizei, 
for dealing with foreigners and with those political forces inside 
Germany which were openly or in secret aiming at the overthrow of 
the Constitution. It had a very restricted scope and was not very 
efficient. 

The Nazi plans included, therefore, the unifying and nazifying of 
the uniformed police and the formation of a nucleus for a future 
super State police force. 

There already existed inside the Nazi party a few spying and 
information services. One of these was formed from the ranks of the 
SS and developed rapidly after Heydrich had been appointed its 
leader in 1932 . He later admitted officially that already in those 
days the Sicherheitsdienst (S.D. - Security Service), as this SS 
branch was called, prepared itself for the future tasks of staffing 
the coming super police force. 

When Hitler came into power in 1933 the careful preparatory work 







SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 161 


done by Heydrich and his colleagues was put into practice. The Nazis 
knew everything about their opponents; and, with comprehensive 
black-lists and executive power on their side, they were able to 
reduce their political opponents to utter ruin. 

This state of affairs, however, could only be maintained and 
extended if the work, so far done by a small faction of SS - namely, 
the S.D. - was perpetuated and officialised - in a word, if the 
super police force planned for such a long time was organised. This 
was started without delay. 

In Spring, 1933, Himmler was made head of the Munich Police and, 
under him, Heydrich head of the Political Police Section in that 
town. Within a few weeks he had restaffed his forces from the S.D. 
and wholly reorganised their work and procedure. 

Also in 1933 a secret State Police Force, the "Gestapo", with 
extensive powers, was formed by Goering in Prussia. After a year of 
intrigue, Himmler persuaded Goering to appoint him Deputy Chief of 
the Prussian Gestapo and, soon afterwards, in all the provinces of 
Germany he extended his activities to the control of the old 
political police by the process of "infiltration". S.D. members and 
the Nazi aristocracy took the place of any but the most co-operative 
officials. By this process of "infiltration" the influence on the 
police of the party and central executive was increased, and that of 
federal authorities weakened. A decree of Jan. 1934 finally 
subordinated the federal authorities and with them the federal 
police to the Reich Government. 

In 1936 Hitler created by decree a new post of "Chief of the German 
Police in the Reich Ministry of the Interior", to which Himmler, the 
chief of the SS, was appointed. He is thus the chief of Polizei in 
Reichsministerium der Innern; and thus combines State and Party 
functions. 

The description which follows of the detailed organisation of the 
various branches of police will reveal even more clearly than an 
historical account the extent of the control which is exercised by 
the small inner circle of the "chosen" over the millions of ordinary 
German citizens. It will also prepare the student for the spirit in 
which the German police has played and is playing its part in the 
Nazification of Europe. 

Himmler divided the police functions into those of: 

A. CONSTABULARY (Ordnungspolizei - Orpo) under Generaloberst der 
Polizei Daluge. 

1. Town Constabulary (Schutzpolizei - Schupo). 

2. Barrack Police (Kasernierte Polizei). 

3. Rural Police (Gendarmerie). 

4. Motorised Gendarmerie (Motorisierte Gendarmerie). 

5. Railway Police (Bahnschutzpolizei). 

6. Water Police (Wasserschutzpolizei). 

7. Technical Emergency Corps (Technische Nothilfe - Teno). 



162 SOE SYLLABUS 


8. Auxiliary Police (Hilfspolizei). 

B. SECURITY POLICE (Sicherheitsoolizei - Sipo) under Ernst 

Kaltenbrunner. 

1. Criminal Police (Kriminalpolizei - Kripo). 

2. Secret State Police (Geheime Staatspolizei - Gestapo). 

3. Security Service (Sicherheitsdienst - SD). 

A. CONSTABULARY 

1. Town Constabulary (Schutzpolizei). 

a. Duties . Employed generally in Germany. Performs ordinary 
patrol and traffic duties and is generally responsible for law 
and order. Semi-military body. 

b. Organisation ■ In large towns Schupo are organised into Groups, 
Districts and Sections. Groups exist only in Berlin, Hamburg 
and Vienna; and a small town may only have a section. 

c. Unifonn. Greenish field-grey uniform with brown cuffs and 
collar and a shako. Black riding boots or leggings. Black 
equipment. The official police emblem (the eagle and swastika, 
enclosed in and resting on a wreath of oak leaves) is worn on 
left sleeve and on centre of shako (or field cap and steel 
helmet, when worn). 

Note : The old dark blue tunic and black breeches are still 
worn, especially by reservists posted to the Town Police to 
replace the serving police who have been sent to occupied 
territory. Reservists in blue uniform have occasionally been 
seen in occupied territory. 

2. Barrack police (Kasernierte Polizei). 

a. Duties in Occupied Territory . Barrack Police to date are only 
working in Norway, H olland and.Po. la nd. There are none in 
France and Belgium. Besides their main function of dealing 
with civil disorder, they are used for a variety of tasks - 
e.g. suppression of guerrilla bands, searches for illegal 
arms, transfer of population, escorting prisoners or others 
going to compulsory work, protection of German L. of C. etc. 
Much of their work demands close co-operation with G.F.P., 
F.G., Gestapo and S.D. 

b. Organisation . Are really a section of the Town Constabulary. 
They are organised into Battalions and live in barracks. These 
battalions are generally organised into Regiments - three bns. 
per regt.; one regt. per district. In the case of Poland, 
these regiments are given the name of their district — e.g. 
Polizeiregiment Warsaw. The regiments are either stationed in 
the chief town of the district or scattered in the larger 
towns - e.g. Polizeiregiment Lublin: the Regt. H.Q. is at 
Lublin, and the battalions are in Lublin, Chelm and Zamosc. 













SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 163 


Apart from these regiments, there is usually a certain number 
of independent battalions. The organisation and equipment of 
the police regiments and battalions are similar to those of 
equivalent units of motorised infantry. The strength of a 
battalion is 500-700 men. In every regiment and independent 
battalion there have been created so-called Polizei-Jagdzuge, 
composed of 40-50 men, specially trained and equipped, with 
lorries and motor-cycles. These platoons are always in a state 
of immediate readiness. 

c. Uniform . Greenish field-grey uniform of Germany Army pattern 
but with dark brown collar and cuffs with two silver buttons 
on each cuff. The national emblem is not worn at all, but the 
police badge (a large laurel wreath enclosing an eagle with 
outstretched wings) is worn on the upper left sleeve and on 
front of field service cap. Rank badges on shoulder straps are 
same as for the army. 

d. Training . Recruits receive political, as well as intensive 
military and police training - especially in street fighting 
and guerrilla warfare. 

3. Rural Constabulary (Gendarmerie) 

a. Duties . Their duties are those of a rural constabulary. 

b. Organisation . The Gendarmerie operate in areas where there are 
no Schupo. 

c. Uniform . Is same as for the Town Constabulary, but their 
boots, leggings and equipment are brown instead of black. 

4. Motorised Police . (Motorisierte Gendarmerie). 

a. Duties . They control traffic on ordinary roads and on 
Autobahnen. They have in this war been employed occasionally 
in occupied territory on traffic control and prevention of 
sabotage in rear areas. 

b. Organisation . Really a branch of the Gendarmerie. They are a 
semi-military body and fully motorised. 

c. Uniform . Uniform is same as for Schupo, but in addition they 
wear a narrow armband on left arm with the words "Motorisierte 
Gendarmerie". 

5. Railway Police . (Bahnschutzpolizei). 

a. Duties ■ Protection of stations and railway junctions, railway 
workshops, transport - whether stationary or on the move - 
railway bridges; suppression of illegal transport of food 
etc.; control of passengers. 

b. Organisation . Organised into Bahnschutzwachen, which operate 
at railway stations. 













164 SOE SYLLABUS 


c. Uniform . The position is not at all clear. Recent information 
suggests three different uniforms: 

i. Old blue railway police uniform, 

ii. Same but in field grey. 

iii. Waffen SS uniform with an armband - "SS Bahnschutz". 

d. Method . In carrying out these tasks the Bahnschutzwachen are 
aided by guarding units of the Army, SS or police battalions; 
though, in Western Europe, the National Police of the 
particular country is responsible for Railway Police work. 

6. Water Police (Wasserschutzpolizeil. 

a. Duties . It performs invaluable and multifarious duties, both 
as normal harbour police and as port security and control 
police, in conjunction with the Security Services. 

b. Organisation . The Water Police are organised on inland 
waterways and at ports throughout the Reich. They also provide 
personnel for coast-guard service (Marine-Kustenpolizei - MKP) 
which is stationed along the whole coastline of occupied 
Europe, on the Danube and elsewhere. 

c. Uniform . Water Police wear a dark blue uniform with a reefer 
jacket and blue peaked cap. The coastguards wear same uniform 
but in addition a yellow armband (Wehrmachtsband). 

7. Technical Emergency Corps (Technische Nothilfe). 

a. Duties . Restore vital communications, fit lighting 
installations, repair broken-down machinery, etc. 

b. Organisation . Formed as auxiliary corps of technical 
experts to deal with break-down of public services. Teno 
commandos have been sent to occupied territories to work 
with Armed Forces. They are under the orders of the Police 
Commander. 

c. Uniform . In Germany, dark blue uniform; abroad, army pattern 
uniform with narrow armband eight inches from the bottom of 
the left sleeve, bearing in white on a dark background the 
words "Techische Nothilfe". 

8. Auxiliary police (Hilfspolizei) 

a. Duties . To help the uniformed police. 

b. Organisation . In the early part of the war, auxiliary Police 
were enrolled in Berlin in Battalions. Since then German 
nationals living in conquered countries have been enrolled for 
part-time duties with Police. In addition, in Holland and 
Poland, for example, Dutch and Poles have been recruited for 
the same purpose. 














SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 165 


c. Uniform . Generally the same as ordinary Schupo uniform; but 
this varies in different countries. 

B. SECURITY POLICE 

1. Criminal Police (Kriminalpolizei - Kripo) 

a. Duties . The specific task of the Kripo is the detection and 
prevention of crime so long as it has no political motive. Is 
not employed in Western Europe, but is working in Poland. 

b. Organisation . Criminal Police stations (Kripostellen) exist in 
all main towns and districts. In rural districts or small 
towns the nearest Kripostelle directs the work through the 
Gendarmerie. 

c. Uniform . Its members are plain-clothes men. 

2. Secret State Police (Geheime Staatspolizei - Gestapo). 

a. Duties ■ These vary in individual countries, but in the main 
are: 

i. Discovering and destroying all forces, either organised or 
not, which are acting or may act to the detriment of the 
National Socialist Party, the State or the German nation. 

ii. Keeping a check on and selecting the directing personnel in 
all spheres of state and national life. 

iii. Enforcing rules and orders regulating the flow of economic 
and political life. 

b. Organisation ■ H.Q. are in Berlin, in Colombia House, Prinz 
Albrechtstrasse. The Gestapo has three main departments which 
work in close co-operation yet possess an individual 
authority. 

Abteilung I . Organisation and administration of the Gestapo. 
Security of Government offices. Central card index and 
supervision of concentration camps. 

Abteilung II . Handles political matters connected with the 
security of the Party and State. It watches the activities of 
all opposition movements (e.g. Communists and Social 
Democrats, Freemasons, Churches, etc.) 

Abteilung III . Contre-espionage. Subdivided into three main 
departments: East, West and South; each of which has 
subsections specialising in one or more countries. In occupied 
territory it regulates and controls political life and all 
social activities; combats all symptoms of national political 
life - secret organisations, underground press etc. - and sees 
to the loyalty of all Germans living in the country. It also 
watches people in key positions. 













166 SOE SYLLABUS 


c. Territorial Organisation in Germany . Gestapo Officers are 
organised under the following terms, shown in order of 
importance: 

i. Staatspolizeileitstelle (Stapolste) - provincial office, 

ii. Staatspolizeistelle (Staposte) - larger towns, 

iii. Aussenstelle - works under Staposte. 

iv. Grenzdientstelle - frontier posts. 

In villages where police are represented by one single 
constable, he has to look after Gestapo as well. Gestapo 
officials may interfere or take over if they wish to do so. 

d. Occupied Territory . The organisation of the Gestapo is not 
rigid but will be adapted to suit local conditions. The 
important bureaux or Stellen work openly, but they direct and 
control other posts which are secret. These secret posts will 
vary in number according to the density of the population, the 
importance of the area and the amount of underground activity. 

e. Ho w t he Gest a po w orks. 

i. It works through a network of agents recruited from all 
sections of the population. National minorities are 
widely used. 

ii. It collates their reports and the results of their 
observations. (Black lists.) 

iii. It card-indexes and watches all outstanding individuals 
from all spheres of activity (police, mayors, 
industrialists etc). 

iv. Provocation (creation of secret pro-allied 
organisations). 

v. Penetration. 

vi. Mass arrests - from black lists, special lists of 
professions etc. 

vii. Terror - torture, reprisals. 

f. The Gestapo is above the law. Its activities cannot be 
challenged or investigated. They are summarily covered by the 
authority or the State - e.g. protective custody without 
trial. 

g. Personnel . All Gestapo officials were at one time highly 
trained, but since the occupation of such large hostile areas 
considerable expansion has been necessary. The newcomers to 
the force are of poorer quality and untrained. It is believed 
that non-Germans have been recruited into the Gestapo 

(France). 






SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 167 


h. Conclusion . The Gestapo has had to rely more and more on the 
use of traitors and methods of terrorism, corruption and 
bribery. Without traitors it would be practically ineffective. 
Corruption is spreading to the Gestapo itself. 

i. Uniform . 

Peace-time . Plain clothes or black SS uniform. 

War-time . Field-grey uniform with an open collar worn with 
brown shirt and tie; collar patches like the Waffen SS and the 
SS rank badges, while the shoulder straps carry the ordinary 
military rank indications. As for the Waffen SS, the 
Hoheitsabzeichen is worn on the left sleeve, and on the left 
sleeve just above the cuff there is the same black band with 
white lettering as on the black uniform. 

Frontier Police (Grenzpolizei). 

a. Duties . Checking the infiltration of dangerous influences, in 
the form of news, persons and clandestine supplies etc. 
Censorship of written material coming from abroad other than 
by post. Frontier guards are assisted by Orpo for control of 
passes and patrol service. 

b. Organisation ■ The control of the Frontier Police which is part 
of the Sipo, is in fact the responsibility of the Gestapo. 

They are organised in motor-cycle and pedal-cycle squads 
(Staffeln). Control is exercised from the local Gestapo 
station, via the Frontier Police Commissariats, to Frontier 
Police Posts. Frontier guards who man Frontier Police 
Commissariats etc. are mainly SS men. 

c. Uniform . SS uniform with narrow armlet bearing the word 
"Grenzpolizei", and are armed with revolvers, carbines, tommy- 
guns and light machine-guns. 

3. Security Service (Sicherheitsdienst - SD) 

a. Duties . It appears that its work is divided into three main 
branches; 

i. Study and penetration of all political movements which 
may prove useful or hostile to National Socialism. 

ii. Contre-espionage, contre-sabotage and contre-propaganda 
work of all kinds, and in particular the prevention and 
detection of corruption among German officials. 

iii. Espionage in neutral allied countries not completely 
under German control - e.g. Hungary and Vichy France. 

It would appear that the S.D. does same work as the Gestapo, 
but on a higher level. It may be that it actually directs the 
Gestapo work. It is certain that it is even more dangerous, 
as its personnel is composed of specially selected members of 
the S.S. 











168 SOE SYLLABUS 


B. Organisation . Although we know little enough of the activities 
of the S.D., an efficient organisation is known to exist in 
each of the occupied countries. 

When Himmler took over the whole of the German Police in 1936, 
he restaffed it with men from the S.D.; but the S.D. itself 
still continued. It was co-ordinated in its work and 
administration with the Gestapo. Both were incorporated in the 
Sicherheitspolizei, whose chief was Heydrich. 

C. Uniform in War-time . As for the Gestapo, but, in addition, a 
diamond-shaped black tab with the letters S.D. in white is 
worn on the bottom of the left sleeve. 

NATIONAL POLICE OF STUDENT'S OWN COUNTRY . 

All available information on the national police of the Student's 

particular country will be given. 

GERM AN CIVIL POLICE CONTROL IN OCCUPIED TERRITORIES 

A. Eastern Europe . 

In Eastern Europe, where administration is entirely German, 
police control is in the hands of an H.SS.PF (Higher Police and 
SS Chief) who is in fact a Himmler in miniature and commands all 
police and SS in the particular country. Although natives do many 
police duties, they only do so either in the ranks of the German 
police organisations or under direct German control. 

B. Western . Europe . 

In Western Europe control is of a different and less obvious 
kind. Civil administration in general is either under different 
varieties of direct German control (in Norway, Belgium, France) 
or remains in the hands of the native governments (in Denmark, 
France). 

Whether or not an H.SS.PF is appointed for an individual country, 
the police of that country carry out most of the duties of the 
uniformed, and in some cases plain clothes, branches under German 
supervision and in accordance with German directives. The odium 
for repression is therefore placed in the first instance on the 
national police. 

C. Conclusion . 


German police control thus varies in different countries, and the 
student will be given the latest information on his own country.

GERMAN MILITARY POLICE 
GERMAN MILITARY SECURITY POLICE 

GERMAN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE 

1. MILITARY POLICE (FELDGENPARMERIE) 

a. Duties . 

They are of two categories: 

i) Ordinary military police duties, such as traffic control 
(their most usual task), collection of stragglers, burial 
of the dead, control of fire-fighting, prisoner-of-war 
cages, etc. 

ii) Enforcement of general security measures; supervision of 
national police of occupied countries; minor 
investigations and controls, carried out either on their 
own initiative or, more usually, on directives issued by 
the Secret Field Police. If acting on their own 
initiative, they must at all times inform the Secret 
Police, who will decide on any further action which may be 
necessary. 

All members of the armed forces are bound to help the F.G. if 
called upon to do so. 

b. Organisation- 

The F.G. is a corps of military police under army orders. It 
is composed of battalions, companies, platoons and sections. 

In general practice, an army disposes of at least one 
battalion, a corps and division of one company each; Feld and 
Ortskommandantur dispose of one section each. 

c. Un i f o rm . 

The F.G. wear army uniform with the addition of: 

i) Police badge (the eagle and swastika in an oval of oak 
leaves) on the upper left arm. 

ii) A narrow brown arm-band stitched to the lower part of the 
left arm with the word "Feldgendarmerie" in aluminum- 
coloured gothic script. The Waffenfarben piping is yellow. 

When on duty the F.G. personnel carry a white metal chain 
round their necks from which is suspended a semi-lunar brass 
plate with "Feldgendarmerie" inscribed on it. 










170 SOE SYLLABUS 


d. Personnel . 

The personnel, both officers and men, of the F.G. is primarily 
drawn from the civil uniformed police, but members of the 
armed forces may, if suitable, be drafted into the F.G. They 
must also be of the N.C.O. type. 

2. SECRET FIELD POLICE (GEHEIME FELDPOLIZEI1 

The principal executive security organization in military areas 
is the G.F.P. 

a. put ies• 

i) To discover and destroy enemy espionage, sabotage and 
para-military organizations. 

ii) To see to the execution of all security measures. 

iii) To act as security advisers, principally to the Ic/AO 
(Security Officer at Army H.Q.) but also to all other 
security officers. 

b. Organization . 

i) It is purely a military organization. Normally allocated 
on the basis of one G.F.P. Truppe per army. 

ii) Occupied Territory. Information suggests that there is a 
G.F.P. Truppe in most important towns in areas under 
military control. These sections are subdivided into sub¬ 
sections, each sub-section specializing in certain work - 
e.g. contra-sabotage, contra-para-military organizations, 
etc. 

c. Uniform. 

i) Mostly in plain clothes. 

ii) When in uniform, army uniform of the army official 

(Wehrmachtsbeamte) is worn, with on the shoulder-straps 
the letters G.F.P. in brass (yellow metal). 

d. Rights and Privileges . 

i) By virtue of their light blue pass, G.F.P. officials are: 

- Authorized in urgent cases to call upon the immediate 
services of the Feld Gendarmerie or any other member of 
the armed forces in so far as their duties permit; 

- Authorized to enter any military office or building, 
pass through any military barrier, and make use of all 
means of communication. 









SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 171 


ii) By an order of Hitler, dated 15th August, 1941, they have 
the power of command over all N.C.O.'s and O.R.'s in the 
German Army. 

iii) They are empowered to make provisional arrests of members 
of the armed forces and of the civilian population. 

e. How the G.F.P, Work . 

They have working for them a great number of agents, and they 
rely chiefly on penetration, provocation, informers, etc. 
Agents working for them are never received at the H.Q. but in 
residences which are specially taken for this purpose. 

In security matters generally, they use the Feldgendarmerie 
and the national police for minor investigations and controls. 

f. Personnel. 

They are not usually professional policemen, but civilians in 
uniform - e.g. barristers, professors, accountants, actors, 
etc. 

3. INTELLIGENCE SERVICE . 

a) general. 

The Intelligence Service is the senior German Intelligence 
authority in and outside Germany taking precedence over the 
Gestapo and all other security, police and frontier 
authorities. It is important, therefore, in making a full 
study of German C.E., to understand its organization and 
duties. 

b) History . 

i) The German Intelligence in the last war, under Col. 

Nickolai, was responsible for the censorship of the Press 
and the maintenance of morale at home as well as the main 
aspects of intelligence work. 

In the present war most of that work has been taken over 
by the Nazi Party. 

ii) Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was 
allowed to maintain a contra-espionage service but not an 
offensive intelligence service. This was known as the 
"Abwehrdienst" (Defence Service), or Abwehr for short. It 
was not long before this so-called contra-espionage 
service became an offensive secret service under various 
guises such as the Oberseedienst (Overseas Service) which 
was ostensibly commercial. Prominent industrialists also 
began to employ ex-secret service officers in positions 
where they could work undercover. The head of the "Abwehr" 
is or was until recently Admiral Canaris.

SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 173 


c) Organization . 


i) The Abwehr is an inter-service organization working for 
the Army, Navy, Airforce and War Economics Directorate. It 
is part of the Wehrmachtsamt under the German High Command 
(O.K.W.), for whom it discharges all intelligence 
functions - espionage, sabotage, contra-espionage and a 
certain amount of propaganda work. (See chart) 

ii) The Headquarters of the Abwehr . known as the Abwehramt, is 
in Berlin and controls directly or indirectly all stations 
of the Abwehr organization throughout the world. It is 
divided into three main departments (Abteilung). 

Abteilung I - Intelligence 
Abteilung II - Sabotage 
Abteilung III - Contra-Espionage 

It is also divided laterally into Army, Navy, Airforce and 
Economics. (See following diagram)

Thus,

Abteilung III-M = Contra-Espionage (Navy) 

Abteilung Ill-Wi = Protection of Industry. 

Abteilung I-Luft = Espionage of interest to the Airforce. 

Abteilung I is further subdivided into areas, i.e. I-H (west) 

Abteilung III is further subdivided into numbered departments, 
i.e. III-H-4 


Abteilung II seems to be organized rather differently from the 
others and is divided as follows: 


(Eastern Europe &amp; the East) 
II East 


II 0/N II 0/S 

(East-North) (East-South) 


(W.Europe &amp; W.Hemisphere)

(West-North) (West-South) 








1 74 SOE SYLLABUS 


iii) Organization in occupied territory . 


- Abwehrstellen. 

Within the territory under German control, branches of 
head office called Abwehrstellen (Asts) are opened in the 
more important towns. They carry out in their prescribed 
areas the same functions as Headquarters and are 
subdivided vertically and laterally in the same way. 


In Germany itself there are eighteen main Asts in all but 
three of the twenty-one Army Commands (Wehrkreis). Five of 
these Asts control groups of stations abroad: 


Berlin: 

Hambourg: 

Vienna: 
Wiesbaden: 
Studgart: 


The Iberian Peninsula, Italy, Scandinavia, 
Russia and others. 

The British Empire, North and South America, 
Turkey and others. 

The Balkans and the Near East. 

France and the French Colonies. 

Switzerland and others. 


The chief of an Abwehrstellen is known as a Leiter, and if 
the station is large enough there will be a Leiter for 
each of its three groups. 


- Nebenstellen . (Nests) 

These are subordinate to the Abwehrstellen. The 
organization is the same. The division of duties between 
the three departments is recognized, though it may mean 
that one man acts in three different capacities. The 
function of a Nest will depend largely on local 
conditions; i.e. a Nest on the coast of Norway will 
probably be largely concerned with naval matters. 


- Abwehror t (A.O.) 

Subordinate to the Nests, with a staff of approximately 
one officer and five men. 


- Meldekopf . 

Usually a kind of postbox where agents can receive and 
send their reports. It is used in order to conceal from 
agents the location of the more important offices. 

It can be safely said that there is no major town in German 
occupied territory, and few in neutral Europe, which does 
not have a local Abwehr station. E.g. Oslo controls Bergen, 
Aalesund, Trondheim, etc. Petris controls Cherbourg, Le Havre, 
Brest, etc. 

Each Abwehr station is a replica of Headquarters, even 
though it may have a very small staff. It represents all 
three departments for all four services, though it will 
probably specialize in certain types of work. 







SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 175 


iv) Organization Abroad . 

- Aussenstellen . 

In foreign countries not under German control Abwehr stations 
have been established, usually equipped with W.T. sets and 
taking their orders from the appropriate Ast in Germany; i.e. 
a station in Turkey would probably take orders from Hambourg. 

- Embassies and Consulates . 

The Abwehr also work through these channels and are at 
present using Japanese, Spanish, Swiss, etc. embassies and 
consulates where they cannot use their own. 

- Abwehrkommandos . 

These are mobile units sent in with invasion troops. They 
were usually recruited, shortly before operations were due to 
begin, from the nearest Ast to the theatre of the proposed 
operations, and were disbanded when the operations were over. 

Their functions consisted, among other things, of 

- Spreading short term propaganda. 

- Preventing destruction of materials and buildings vital 
to the Germans. 

- Rounding up nationals of the country on the Abwehr black 
list. 

4. maln_functio^s_o^he._mteil.umg. 

a) Ab tg il. u ng._I, - 

The main function of this department is to obtain information 
for all four services over a very wide field by means of 
secret agents. 

Examples of Activities: 

i) Detailed information of the allies' war potential before 
the outbreak of war. 

ii) Comprehensive shipping information. 

iii) Meteorological information by means of stations in 
Greenland and other parts of the north. 

iv) Detailed military information from agents on the Turkish 
General Staff. 

b) Abteiluna II . 

i) This department is concerned with sabotage of the enemy 
war machine which includes the spreading of rumours and 
propaganda. 

ii) It works in close co-ordination with the services, and it 
is a fundamental principle that acts of sabotage should 









176 SOE SYLLABUS 


be carried out in accordance with a general plan and not 
on isolated occasions. 

iii) The object of these combined operations is to destroy 

communications and supplies of the enemy and damage their 
morale. 

iv) Detailed preparation beforehand is the general rule. 
Examples of Activities: 

- Fifth Column Activities immediately prior to and during 
invasions and creation of spy psychosis. 

- Sabotage campaign in Spain against British shipping, 

c) Abteilunq III. 

This department is responsible for Counter-Espionage, Counter- 
Sabotage and Counter-Propaganda within the Wehrmacht, i.e. 

C.E. in the widest sense, and makes great use of penetration. 


5. METHODS . 

a) In order to acquire information the Abwher employs a large 
number of informers, local police, quislings, rewards and 
particularly blackmail. 

b) Their penetration system is very highly developed. E.g. 
Founding escape organizations, recruiting nationals of a 
country ostensibly on behalf of a pro-ally organization and 
allowing them to build up their own ring and even indulge in 
minor acts of sabotage. 

- Sooner or later such a ring will be bound to find itself in 
touch with a genuine allied organization. 

- They are prepared to let one of their agents who has 
penetrated an organization run for a considerable time 
before they take action on his reports. 

- They frequently arrest their own agents for purposes of cover. 

c) D.F.-ing, although under a separate military organization is 
closely controlled by the Abwehr. 

d) Censorship is probably controlled by the Abwehr. 

e) They are as much interested in building up an order of battle 
of enemy organizations as in actually catching a single enemy 
agent, in order that they may uncover a complete organization. 

f) The principle executive arm of the Abwehr in occupied 
territory is the G.F.P. They also frequently call in the 
services of the Gestapo. 





SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 177 


g) Where subversive activity is wide-spread in a military area 
the G.F.P., the F.G., the Gestapo, the S.D. and the local 
police will probably act in unison under the directions of 
Abteilung III. 

6. RELATIONS WITH THE S.D. AND GESTAPO . 

The three departments work closely together. The difference 
between them is as follows: 

a) The S.D. deals entirely with political matters. E.g. They sent 
agents to work with Ribbentrop, when he was ambassador in 
London to investigate pacifist elements in England, and many 
of their agents were responsible for the corruption of French 
politicians and industrialists seme time prior to the invasion 
of France. 

b) The Abwehr is responsible for espionage, sabotage and contra- 
espionage in connection with the Armed Forces (Wehrmacht). 

c) The Gestapo performs executive functions for the S.D. and Abwher. 

It is inevitable that the functions of these three organizations 
should overlap and as a result a certain amount of dissension 
between them occur. This is known to have happened, as between 
the Abwehr and the Gestapo who made a point of poaching on the 
Abwehr's preserves in order to enhance their own prestige. 

7. RECRUITING AND PERSONNEL . 

The Abwehr recruit by the following methods: 

a) The Party, particularly through the Auslands Organization . 

This organization is in close touch with Germans and German 
sympathizers abroad and runs a recruiting organization in 
order to put people in touch with the Abwehr. 

b) Concentration Camps . People are released from concentration 
camps on condition that they work as German agents. The fear 
of returning is so great that it has the desired affect. E.g. 
"K.R", who was caught in May 1941 in England had been sent 
back to a concentration camp after training and before going 
over to England in order to impress upon him what would happen 
should he fail. 

c) Labour Exchanges ■ particularly at seaports. 

d) By threats of violence against themselves and relatives. 

e) By blackmail. 

PERSONNEL . 

The majority of agents in the field, at any rate those who have 
been caught, have been non-Germans of low quality and low 
character, motivated by the desire for money and by fear. 








178 SOE SYLLABUS 


The Abwehr officers are usually German and drawn from the Armed 
Forces. 

During 1940-41, evidence connected with agents landed in the U.K. 
shows that they were badly treated, badly organized, ignorant of 
conditions in the U.K., and dissatisfied with their pay and 
treatment by the Abwehr Officers. The explanation of this 
probably is that they were sent in large numbers regardless of 
quality in the hopes that some would get through, since the 
invasion was considered so imminent. 

It must be presumed, however, that a large number of extremely 
efficient Abwehr agents are still at work as there is no doubt 
that the enemy frequently receive first-rate information of 
allied activities. E.g. Submarine warfare. 

8. TRAINING . 

A number of training establishments for the Abwehr are located in 
Germany proper and in occupied territories. 

Abteilung II frequently draws upon the Lehr Regiment. Brandenburg 
for saboteurs and pre-invasion troops. 

This Regiment was formed in January 1940 to take care of 
Auslandsdeutche arriving from abroad, and has grown into three 
separate Battalions. It is administratively self-contained and 
elastic and has no insignia. 

Its main purpose is to train men to work in advance of the Army 
in small parties, and for special undertakings in connection with 
military operations. I.e. The attack on the railway at Daba, 

North Africa prior to Rommel's advance into Eygpt. 

9. CO NC LUSION. 

The Abwehr is directed by the O.K.W. and acts in close co¬ 
operation with the general staff; their activities often give a 
clue to moves by the O.K.W.; for example: 

a) Their activity prior to 1940 was mainly directed against 
France. 

b) After the fall of France their activities were concentrated on 
the U.K. with a view to invasion. E.g. Between September and 
November 1940 over twenty-five agents were known to have 
arrived in the U.K. 

c) Information concerning the Ast in Vienna and its connections 
with the Middle East in 1942, suggested immediate plans of the 
O.K.W. concerning moves in Egypt and the Caucasus. 

d) Recruiting and mobilising of Abwehrkommandos often gives a clue 
to the military situation. E.g. Preparation of these bodies was 
begun in Vienna six weeks before the Yugoslav Campaign.

NOTES QN 

ACTIVITIES OF THE ABWEHR 

1. Concentration at the Centre of Operational Zone . 

a) From 1933 - 1939 Abwehr was active against Britain and France. 
About 30 agents were discovered, all controlled by Hamburg. 
(Mrs. Jessie Jordan, Mrs. Brandy) 

11 of these reported themselves. 

6 reported by suspicious private persons. 

9 caught through using the post to write to cover addresses. 

3 by official action. 

1 as a result of letter being found. 

Development of Auslands Organization in Britain suggested 
possibility of members being used for sabotage; large number 
arrested on outbreak of war. 

Greatest effort concentrated in France, by corruption of 
politicians like Laval, and undermining morale. 

b) After fall of France activities of Abwehr became more 
concentrated on the U.K. with invasion in view, working up to 
a peak in the Fall of 1940, and falling away again after the 
defeat of the Luftwaffe by the R.A.F. in the Battle of 
Britain. 

Six agents caught in Eire between May and July 1940 (Herman 
Goertz), may have had a far reaching effect on German 
strategical plans, which certainly included the invasion of 
Eire. 

September - November 1940, over 25 agents are known to have 
arrived in U.K. by parachute or small boat. Short term agents 
connected with invasion plans. (Druker, Walti and Eriksen, Ter 
Braak) 

Between March and September 1941 a number of agents were 
landed by small boats from Norway. Objects varied from naval 
espionage to penetration by escapees on behalf of counter¬ 
espionage (M.V. Hernie). 

All this tine during 1940 and 1941 a number of long term 
agents were despatched for various purposes (Gerth van Wijk), 
and quite a few seamen were sent via the Iberian Peninsula to 
report on shipping movements, coastal defences, etc. 

(Timmerman) 

Between September 1941 and March 1942, so far as is known, 
Abwehr activity against the U.K. practically ceased. The 
"Battle of Britain" had been won, the "Battle of the Atlantic" 
now occupied the thoughts of the O.K.W. 





180 SOE SYLLABUS 


2. Extens i on of Activities to the Periphery of Operational Zone . 

After the occupation of the Atlantic Coasts of Europe in summer of 
1940 the "Battle of the Atlantic" assumed a more dangerous form, and 
simultaneously the Abwehr began developing its organizations in 
Norway , the Iberian Peninsula , and the Western Hemisphere . The 
Balkans also assumed importance as a base for the threat to the Suez 
Canal Zone , and Middle East . 

At the same time the Abwehr were also entrusted with the obtaining of 
Meteorological Reports and for this purpose made special arrangements 
in Greenland and Janmayen Island . Many of their other agents were 
also required to make meteorological reports as a matter of routine. 

Norway . 

Headquarters is the Abwehrstelle Oslo, which controls five major 
districts with branches at Bergen, Trondheim, Tromsoe and 
Kirkenes. 

Main functions were: 

i) C.E. or III-F activities against Norwegian and Allied 
Intelligence in Norway. 

ii) I.M. undertakings - small boats to Britain, 

iii) Espionage against Russia. 

Bergen . 

Main energies directed to C.E. work owing to activities of 
patriots in that area. 

Very active in organizing double-cross work with "refugees" to 
the U.K. (M-14-N.L &amp; M.V. "Hemie") 

Organized patrols of fishing smacks along Norwegian coast to 
keep watch on "escapees" and penetrated their organizations. 

Trondheim, Trpmsoe and Kirkenes. 

I.M. activities. 

Iberian Peninsula . 

As a result of German help during the Spanish Civil War and 
subsequent Spanish - German relations, the Abwehr have enjoyed 
many advantages, example: 

a) Use of Spanish agents with diplomatic cover. Spanish Embassy 
in London riddled with them. (Suner) 

b) Diplomatic reports, many of them with very detailed accounts 
of times of air-raid alerts, morale, bomb damage, etc. 
















SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 181 


Organization. 


Two parent stations Madrid and Lisbon. 

a) Madrid . 

i) H.Q. Staff of 20 full time German I.O.'s and about 30 
others in out stations. H.Q. housed in German Embassy. 

ii) San Sebastian, Bilboa, Vigo, Huelva, Cadiz, Algeciras, 

La Linea, Cartagena, and Barcelona, Morocco (Tetuan), 
Canary Islands, Spanish Guinea and Fernande Po. with 
sub-stations. 

iii) San Sebastian deals with the transit of agents. 

Barcelona responsible for IM &amp; IW work and supposed to 
have a training school. 

iv) Abteilung III also represented. 

b) Lisbon . 

i) Similar organization to Madrid though not so big; all 
officers work in German Legation. 

ii) Permanent out stations all overseas - Azores, Cape 

Verde, Bissau and Lourengo Marques, and mostly manned by 
Portuguese who are not very satisfactory. 

iii) Bissau works into Gambia and Sierre Leone, Lourengo 
Marques works into South Africa. 

iv) Abteilung III also represented. 

Activities • 

i) Despatch of agents from Occupied Europe through Iberian 
Peninsula to South America or Allied Territory. 

ii) Communications by outside agents to cover addresses in 
Spain or Portugal by secret writing, or courier. One 
German agent on every Spanish ship - usually acting as 
courier. 

iii) Penetration by Abteilung III into Allied Intelligence 
Services. 

iv) Sabotage - more here than anywhere else, chiefly 

directed against Allied Shipping and military objectives 
in Gibraltar. 

Equipment manufactured in Spain, delay mechanism in 
Germany. Diplomatic bag used for conveying it. Spaniards 
used to do the work, most unreliable (drunk agent at 
Huelva). Abwehr II encourages Spanish Police to arrest 









182 SOE SYLLABUS 


any of doubtful loyalty, rather than be penetrated by 
the Allies. 

Not much sabotage has been done in Lisbon. 

v) An elaborate Watching Organization is in existence, on 
both sides of the Straits, observing Gibraltar - well 
equipped with technical apparatus. 

Western Hemisphere . 

U-S.A. 

Very important base for shipping and production information 
until Fall of 1941 when F.B.I. broke spy ring. Regular flow of 
information between New York and Berlin. Intended for U-Boat 
warfare and the Luftwaffe. 

Good example of penetration by F.B.I., who in fact controlled 
the communications until they were ready to pounce. 

Thereafter information had to go via South America. 

Not much evidence of sabotage. 

Sou t h A m er j.c. 3 . 

Large scale, chiefly directed towards shipping information. 

Quality of agents good; mostly recruited from local German 
population, who have long been educated by the Auslands 
Organization. 

Main centres have been Rio and Valparaiso. 

SabQtggt? • 

Some possibility of sabotage especially in the realm of 
political strife, but no evidence of any concerted plan. 

Conclusion. 

Every network of information very powerful and efficient as 
evidenced by reputation amongst captured U-Boat crews. 

Balkans and Turkey. 


Abteilung II played an important part in the attack on 
Yugoslavia. 

H.Q. in Vienna controlled sub-branches in the other Balkan 
capitals. 









SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 183 


By April 1941 sabotage agents were grouped around the main 
centres, Split, Zagareb, Belgrade and Skoplye, housed in the 
German consulate and working directly under M.A. Belgrade. 

Agents were recruited from Volkdeutchen, and received assistance 
from local German firms - Lehr. Regt. Brandenburg also used. 

Unlimited funds were available but strict instructions were 
given against any premature action. 

Alarmist rumours and propaganda directed at disuniting the 
population were widely used. 

Greece. 

Abteilung II were thoroughly prepared by the time the Italians 
invaded Greece. 

After the occupation sub-stations of Abteilung I were 
established around the Aegean at places like Chios and Lemnas to 
obtain detailed information on the military dispositions of 
Turkey. 

Schools were set up in Athens and Salonika for the purpose of 
training Arabs. 

H.Q. of Abteilung II at Athens was in close touch with Rommel, 
controlled agents in Syria, Iraq, Armenia, etc., and penetrated 
the Greek Army in Egypt and the French Army in Syria for the 
purpose of undermining morale. 

Turkey . 

Hamburg opened a sub-branch in Ankara, but Berlin also 
controlled the Lietstelle Naher-Orient there. The two chiefs 
quarrelled - the situation had to be adjusted by Canaris in 
person. 

Ankara was the chief source of information until 1941, when 
Athens, Salonika, and Istanbul took over. 

End of 1940 considerable number of saboteurs known to be in 
Turkey with plans for destroying plants and power houses. Used 
as jumping-off ground for saboteurs for the East and even India, 
also as a recruiting ground for pro German Arabs. 

Lot of information obtained from Turkish officials in Ankara until 
1942 when the Government took a stiffer attitude towards Germany. 

Pera Palace explosion was the work of Abteilung II. 

Middle East. 

Preparatory Moves . 

In 1938 Alfred Rosenberg became interested in the Middle East. 





184 SOE SYLLABUS 


Arab residents in Berlin were approached and a "Permanent 
Defence Committee" was set up to contact the Arab world. But the 
Arabs used the Germans as much as the Germans sought to use the 
Arabs. 


Abwehr did not make much headway until the collapse of France. 
Then set up H.Q. in Beirut with the intention of making it the 
centre of activities in the M.E. - in autumn of 1941 had 400 - 
500 agents. 

British invasion of Syria drove the Abwehr back to Turkey. 


Iraq . 

Activities centred around the German Legation in Bagdad, where 
Dr. Grobba, the Minister, an Arab expert, was fairly successful. 
He had been there some years. The removal of the Mufti of 
Jerusalem to Bagdad in 1939 also helped to make that city the 
centre of intrigue. 

Iran . 

Centre of Abwehr activity was German Legation in Teheran. Irwin 
Ettel, the Minister, controlled three classes of agents: 

a) His own service, local and German. 

b) A group of officers under the Military Attache. 

c) An organization set up by the Mufti. 

Egypt . 

The German colony was organized in the usual hierarchy by the 
Auslands Organization, and evidence shows that the latter were 
closely connected with the Abwehr. 

On the outbreak of war the arrest of the suspect Germans made it 
necessary for the Abwehr to fall back on the Italian Secret 
Service. The Germans, no doubt had acquired considerable 
influence then in Rome. 

On the entry of Italy into the weir both nations fell back upon 
Japan, and when the latter entered the Spanish Legation seems to 
have been the purveyor of information to the Axis. 

The activities of the Abwehr became extremely complicated and 
difficult to unravel, 

a) Because no one AST controlled Egypt, many had a finger in the 
pie. 



SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 185 


b) The importance of these ASTS, such as Ankara, fluctuated. 

c) The Italians played an important role. 

Arabia . 

Germans left Transjordan, Saudi Arabia and the Yemen to the 
Italians, who were also interested in Palestine. Mussolini 
regarded this part of the world as his zone of influence and 
subsidized the Syrian Nationalist Leader. 

Ibn Saud refused to have anything to do with the Germans and the 
Italian Legation at Jedda, the centre of Italian Secret Service 
work, was closed in February 1942. 

The Italians were more successful in the Yemen, where 
intelligence work was carried out by means of medical stations 
in the various towns giving free treatment; but the Imam refused 
to be drawn in against the British. 

Italians also had a station at Aden established in 1934. 

It is known that the Asts in Hamburg, Ankara, Cyrenaica, Lisbon 
and Sofia (Luft) all had agents in Arabia. 

Palestine. 

Activity of Abwehr increased in March 1941. 

Apart from trained Germans sent into the country, the local 
German Colony, established 1880 and very pro-Nazi, were used, as 
well as Jews who had fled from Jewish persecution but were still 
pro-German; but mostly Arabs, Syrians and Armenians were used. 
Some German agents were sent in as volunteers for the British 
forces. 

3. Extension &lt;?f A c tiv ities b eyond Op erational zone- 

West Africa . 

Indication of a net-work of agents among old German Colonists. 
South Africa . 

Abteilung II fairly active amongst dissident population. 
Portugese East Africa used as a jumping-off ground. 

January 1942 there were widespread acts of sabotage connected 
with Robey Leibrandt, who had been trained in politics and 
Nazi propaganda, and admitted being sent to South Africa in 
1941 to start a rebellion, but the Ossewa Brandwag, a South 
African subversive organization, refused to co-operate with 
him 


Instructions were issued to Abwehr agents to avoid isolated 







1 86 SOE SYLLABUS 


acts of sabotage and work to a pre-arranged plan: it is not 
clear whether this outbreak of sabotage was premature or timed 
to influence the Battle of Libya by drawing off South African 
troops. 

India . 

Branches of the Auslands Organization existed before the war, 
which may have served as a base for the usual preparatory 
activity. 

The usual German-Italian intrigues in Afghanistan were 
probably controlled from India. 

Abteilung II organized training for Indians in Kassel, the 
idea being to drop them on the Russo-Indian border to raise a 
revolt. 

China ■ 

There was an organization in Shanghai used for obtaining naval 
information until 1941. 

In 1939 there was a Hamburg agent in Dutch East Indies to 
obtain intelligence on Singapore and naval and shipping 
movements. 

Austra l i a. 

A very small German community in Australia and New Zealand, 
each with the usual Auslands Organization, but no indication 
of subversive activity.

GERMAN ARMY 
General Organization 


A. THE WEHRMACHT . 

To know something of the history of the German Army is essential 

for a proper understanding of its position and character today. 

1. Pre-1918 . 

Until the Treaty of Versailles the German Army was composed of 
contingents of troops from the Federal States - Prussia, 

Saxony, Bavaria and Wurtemburg. Each had its own War Minister 
and its own Army, and each king commissioned his own officers, 
but armaments and training were uniform. 

It was a conscript army of 850,000 men. At the time of the 
Armistice the German Army was 240 divisions - approximately 
5,000,000 men. 

2. Treaty of_Vers.ail.les. 

Object was to make aggression inpossible for Germany. Means 
taken were: 

a) The German army was reduced to 100,000 men, including 
maximum of 4,000 officers, organized in 7 Infantry 
Divisions and 3 Cavalry Divisions. 

Conscription forbidden. Voluntary enlistment was for 12 years 
for N.C.O.'s and O.R.'s, and 25 consecutive years for 
officers, to make it inpossible to build up a trained reserve. 

b) Weapons were also restricted. There were no aircraft, 
A.F.V.'s, guns or hows of more than 10.5 c.m. calibre, A.A. 
or A.Tk. artillery. Fortresses were dismantled, Rhineland 
demilitarised. No general staff or military missions were 
allowed. 

c) Other weapons and ammunition were limited in quantity. 


3. T he R e ich s wehr . 

The name of this limited army, together with the limited navy, 
was the Reichswehr. The Supreme Commander was the President of 
the Republic, who delegated his powers to the Reichswehr 
Minister, under whom were both Services (no Air Force). The 
Reichswehr Minister appointed the C.-in-C. of each Service. 

The first C.-in-C. of the Army (Chef der Heeresleitung) under 








188 SOE SYLLABUS 


the Reichswehr Minister was General von Seeckt, an officer of 
old Imperial Army; such were also the other Reichswehr 
officers. It was an incongruous situation, bound to cause 
trouble, in that a republican, socialist and pacifist state 
had an army officered exclusively by a class which was 
monarchist, reactionary and militarist in character. 

Ostensibly non-political but actually anti-republican, the 
Reichswehr concentrated on building up first-class "cadre" 
army - "the army of N.C.O.'s". 

Von Seeckt was dismissed in 1926. The best-known of his 
successors was von Fritsch, 1934-1938. 

4. Evasion of Treaty of Versailles . 

The Reichswehr early began to evade disarmament clauses and 
the government connived - partly through fear of alienating 
the sympathy of so powerful a body, and partly through the 
love of militarism common to all Germans, even socialists. 

a) Weapons were hidden, not surrendered to Inter-Allied 
Disarmament Commission. 

b) Staff Officers were secretly trained and a skeleton general 
staff was formed. 

c) The number of trained men was increased by premature 
discharges and militarisation of police. 

d) Secret training with gas, aircraft and tanks was carried 
out in Russia after the Treaty of Rapallo, 1922. 

e) Civil aircraft were made convertible to bombers - e.g. 
Junkers 52. 

f) Weapons were made in secret factories and abroad - e.g. 
story of the workman who stole parts from a perambulator 
factory when his wife had a baby but found that when 
assembled they made a machine gun (!) 

All this began long before advent of Hitler. 

5. Hitler - 4c ce_lg r a t e_ d .Expan s ion. 

In January, 1933, Hitler became Chancellor, and expansion of 
the services was accelerated and secrecy was gradually 
abandoned. 

October, 1933: Germany withdrew from the League of Nations 

and Disarmament Conference.

Blomberg and C.-in-C. Fritsch dismissed, 
with 12 generals. With Fritsch disappeared 
the last restraining influence on Nazi 
aggressive designs. 

March, 1938: Austria invaded and Austrian Army 

incorporated in German Army. 


September, 1938: Sudetenland Crisis. Wehrmacht now ready for 

war. 


6. B e .-zQ.rganigaU.on of the Services. 

In February, 1938, when the clean sweep of the Higher Command 

was made, opportunity was taken for a re-organization. 

a) Title of Reichswehr, associated with 100,000-man Army of 
the Republic, was replaced by Wehrmacht (Defence Forces) 
including all three Services. 

b) The post of Reichswehr Minister was abolished and Hitler 
became Supreme Commander (Oberster Befehlshaber) of the 
Wehrmacht. His staff, under his orders, is the High Command 
of the Defence Forces (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht or OKW) 
whose chief is Field Marshal von Keitel (Chef des 
Oberkommandos der Wehrmacht). 

c) The heads of the three services responsible to the 
Oberkommando were: 

Army: Generalfeldmarschall von Brauchitsch. 

Navy: Gross Admiral Raeder. 

Air Force: Reichsmarschall Goering. 

7. New Organization of the Higher Command . 


System instituted in February, 1938, still stands, but Hitler 




190 SOE SYLLABUS 


has taken over the Army personally, and Donitz has replaced 
Admiral Raeder. 


The dismissal of von Brauchitsch in the winter of 1941, and 
the taking over by Hitler himself of the command of the Army, 
was largely a propaganda move. Hitler had been built up as the 
supreme military genius of all time, and consequently a 
scapegoat had to take responsibility for the disasters in 
Russia. Von Brauchitsch was that scapegoat.

(Nos. 701-720). Not suitable for mobile operations unless 
reinforced. 

iii) Training Divs. inside Germany and Z.B.V. Divs. are rated 
as administrative. 

This force of 323 Divisions is scattered over Europe. Many of 
these divisions are locked up in police duties, and by no 
means all can be deployed for one operation. The number has in 
any case to be seriously reduced by the disasters in Russia. 






SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 191 


C. THE ARMY UNDER HITLER . 

Three main aims have been pursued by Hitler during the years 
when the German Forces were being developed: 

1. To Remove the Memory of Defeat in 1918 . 

Intensive propaganda and the easy victories during the 
early years of war led to a considerable measure of success 
in this aim. 

Now the tide has turned and the possibility of defeat is 
present in the mind of every German soldier. He fears the 
revenge which will be taken by the population of occupied 
countries. He fears the prospect of being sent to the 
Russian front. He fears the growing material power of the 
Allies which will soon overwhelm him. Although the pay and 
living conditions of the German soldier in the West are 
good, his morale is low. It should not be inferred, 
however, that he will not fight. Certain sections of the 
armed forces - in particular, the SS and the Air Force - 
will fight to the last, but, generally speaking, there 
seems some prospect that resistance may crumble after stern 
initial fighting. 

2. To Make the German Forces Independent of Foreign Raw 

M9terial3_and-^UPfir.iQr_in_Eguipp)gpt to any Enemy, 

In their attempts to achieve self-sufficiency the Germans 
have had considerable success. Although they have many 
difficulties, their shortages have not so far seriously 
affected the quality of equipment. 

3. To As s ert t he i nflue nce the Pa r t y i n a ll M at ters pf Po licy 

and Confine the Armed Forces to Purely Executive Duties. 

Friction between the Army and the Party is of long 
standing, as can be seen from events since Hitler assumed 
power. Slowly but surely resistance by the army has been 
broken. Officers not loyal to the Party have been retired 
or even assassinated. They have been replaced by men, like 
von Zeitzler, who are thoroughly Nazi in outlook and will 
do as they are told. 

The Party's private army, the Waffen SS, has been developed 
in size with the object of creating a powerful and 
reasonably reliable body under command of the Party. This 
has, of course, led to jealousy between the Army and the SS. 

D. CONCLUSION . 

The German Forces are strained to the utmost. Organizations in 
occupied territory can, by subversion of German troops now and 
by armed intervention later, render invaluable help to the 
Allied cause by supplying just that extra pressure which will 
cause a break.

PROPAGANDA - INTRODUCTORY 

1. WHAT IS PROPAGANDA? 

There are two kinds of propaganda. 

a) Preparational . 

"The art of persuasion with a view to producing, merely, a 
frame of mind." 

E.a . Goebbels persuaded German people to adopt a mental 
attitude vis-a-vis the concept "Lebensraum" before he called 
on them to do anything about it. 

b) Operational ■ 

"The art of persuasion with a view to producing action." 

E.a . To-day it is useless for our propaganda merely to 
persuade Frenchmen that the Boche is a swine. It must also 
instruct Frenchmen how to kick the Boche out of France. 

Our propaganda to enemy and occupied countries is now mainly 
operational? and, as such, should always contain the joint 
elements of persuasion and action. 

2. WHA T CAN PRQP ASANpA PQ? 

These lectures deal only with underground operational propaganda 
- i.e. with propaganda as one weapon in the whole armoury of 
underground warfare. Passive resistance, sabotage, guerrilla 
warfare and internal revolution are other weapons which, with 
propaganda, must be knitted into a whole. 

• 

Thus propaganda, calling in its action element for passive 
resistance, may lead to passive resistance; passive resistance 
plus propaganda may lead to sabotage; passive resistance and 
sabotage plus propaganda to guerrilla warfare etc. (Cf. oil in a 
machine.) 

Therefore propaganda, though an important weapon, is never an 
independent one. It must be co-ordinated with the other weapons 
at our disposal. (Cf. Goebbels' "Fourth Arm".) 

3. WHY DO YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT PROPAGANDA ? 

If ever you are called on to become an organiser, propaganda will 
be one of the weapons at your disposal. It is therefore right 
that you should know its scope, its power and its relation to the 
conduct of underground warfare. 










SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 193 


We shall best perceive these things if we follow, in some detail, 
the career of a propaganda-agent from the moment when, in this 
country, he is told to undertake propaganda work to the moment 
when, in his own country, he has distributed his first leaflet 
among his people. 

4. STARTING-POINT . 

The propagandist finds his raw material in the facts of the 
political situation. A thorough knowledge of such facts as they 
affect his field of operations is essential for successful work. 

5. POLITICS . 

The propagandist's approach to politics should be governed by two 
main considerations: 

a) Politics, which in our grandfathers' day were relatively 
static, have now become fluid. (Cf. British Right and Left 
Wing rapprochement since Russia's entry into the war.) 

The clear picture of the political scene, which an agent 
should initially work out in his area, should not be like a 
chart, map or photograph with its details fixed and rigid, but 
like a moving film at a cinema - where the frame remains fixed 
but contents are mobile. 

b) Politics, to the propagandist, are not merely Party Politics; 
but a detailed examination of every factor affecting the self- 
interest of each group, class and organisation that exists 
within his field of operation. 

6. GROUPINGS. 

It is one of the early duties of a propagandist, even before 
leaving this country, to ascertain what groups exist in his area. 
This gives rise to two questions: 

a) Why? 

Having ascertained a particular political fact that affects 
his area, the propagandist may easily find that each group of 
people has a different attitude to the same political fact. 

Therefore it follows that our propaganda relative to that one 
fact must differ vis-a-vis each group. 

E.a . Propaganda against agricultural plunder by the Boche will 
have to be distinct, if addressed to country-folk who see the 
plunder happening, from that addressed to townsfolk who, 
perhaps, only know that their bellies are empty. 

By addressing our propaganda to a relatively small specific 
group rather than to a large amorphous mass, we ensure that we 
shall appeal more directly to the self-interest of that group 





194 SOE SYLLABUS 


and therefore incite it the more easily to the action 
required. 

This is, in fact, one of the main reasons why we send a 
propaganda-agent to work inside a country since his leaflets, 
alone of all our propaganda media . can be addressed to and 
distributed among a specific group. B.B.C. broadcasts and 
R.A.F. leaflets cannot be thus addressed and distributed with 
certainty of success. 

b) How ? 

It is possible to group any given population under eight main 
headings: 

— Party Political. (Conservative, Liberal, Socialist etc.) 

—Vocational. (Miner, lawyer, journalist etc.) 

— Regional. (Town, country, coast etc.) 

- Religious. (Catholic, Prostestant, agnostic etc.) 

— Age. (Students, Youth Movements, Sports Clubs, Pension 
ex-Servicemen etc.) 

— Sex. (Workers' wives, feminist movements etc.) 

— Economic. (Employers, workers, Trades Unions etc.) 

— National. (Racial minorities.) 

7. CHOICE OF TARGET . 

From the many groups at this disposal, our propagandist must 
choose the few groups that he can most profitably attack. 

E.q. One might ignore extreme loyalists (already sufficiently 
active) and extreme pro-Nazis (already beyond conversion) in 
order to concentrate more effectively on the "attentiste" element 
of a population. 

Once a specific group is chosen, the propagandist must determine 
(very broadly) which of the eight factors listed above is that 
particular group's predominant factor. 

E.q. Socialists: predominantly a Party Political group. 

Students: predominantly an age group. 

He must now ascertain whether the impact of the other seven 
factors on his chosen group is of sufficient importance to 
warrant splitting that group into smaller sub-groups. 

E.q. Q. "Does the fact that there are old, young and middle-aged 
socialists warrant my further splitting the main group?" 





SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 195 


A. "Probably no." 

Q. "Does the fact that there are rich socialists 

(Theoreticians) and poor socialists (practicians) warrant 
my further splitting the main group?" 

A. "Probably yes." 

8. CONCLUSION . 

With his population grouped and a specific group chosen as 
target, the first preparational stage of our propagandist's work 
is complete. 

Two further preparational steps remain to be taken: 

a) The ascertainment of the chosen group's opinion on a given 
political fact or facts. 

b) The receipt from a superior authority of a propaganda line or 
policy. 

These two steps form the subjects of ensuing lectures.

OPINION SAMPLING 

( NOTE : This lecture deals with an activity which can only be 

engaged-in on definite orders and in relation to the specific 
security arrangements made in connection with each individual 
student. The lecturer must make it perfectly clear that he is 
not directing enquiries to be undertaken by students on 
arrival. The general principles which emerge from the talk 
are, however, of importance in all work of appraising a 
milieu.) 

1. PROPAGANDA DEPENDS ON FACTS . 

The propaganda worker must know the facts of the political 
situation. (Cf. C.l). The propagandistic treatment of those facts 
is influenced by the opinions of the public to which propaganda 
is addressed. Methods of investigating opinions quickly and 
accurately form the subject of this talk. 

2. PAN . GERS _.QF_ INADEQUATE ..IN F OR MATION . 

Reports are constantly reaching us, often at the cost of agents' 
lives, to the effect that "German propaganda is being 
successful"; that "The polpulation of region X is 80% pro- 
British". These reports are valueless, because: 

a) they do not yield facts precise enough to form a basis 
for work, and 

b) they are guesses. 

What we need are reports of observed fact, the accuracy of which 
is above suspicion. 

3. INVESTIGATION A S A SCIENC E. 

The science of investigating opinion has made great strides in 
recent years, and the movement of large sums of money in 
commercial advertising and market research is actually determined 
by its findings. Cf. Fortune and Gallup Surveys; Literary Digest 
Straw Votes; Mass Observation. 

Concrete cases of political and commercial propaganda based on 
good or bad interpretations of public opinion. 

(E.g. Petain and Lux soap.) 

4. Investigation methods in their normal peacetime thoroughness are 
obviously not applicable to our work. But the principles that 
govern it must also govern us, just as the propaganda principles 
which govern the vast output of the B.B.C. must also govern the 
small town printer working in a basement by candlelight. 









SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 197 


"THE RANDOM SAMPLING METHOD". 


This is the most accurate method of investigating opinion. 

Broadly it may be described as follows: 

If a large group (Group "A") is under investigation, a sample 
(Sample "a") is taken. If this is accurately done, i.e. if Sample 
"a" is completely representative of Group "A" the trends opinion 
found in the sample will be found in the group, and in the same 
proportions. Similarly for a complicated group (ABCD) when sample 
abed will be required with "a" proportionate to "A" and "b" to 
"B", etc. 

To achieve accuracy, rigid adherence to certain rules is 
required: 

a) A sample nee d not be la rge. 

E.g. the Gallup forecast of Roosevelt's second election was 
based on only 2,000 views out of 130,000,000, yet it came 
within one percent of accuracy. For small town, local or 
craft reconnaissance, a much smaller number is sufficient. 

N.B. Whereas Gallup and other nation-wide surveys organized 
on a commercial profit-making basis require a high degree of 
accuracy, accuracy within 10 or 20% is valuable for 
propaganda guidance. 

NOTE: The introduction to Section 5 and also Para, i) can be 
omitted when students are lacking either command of English or 
minimal grasp of mathematics. 

b) The sample must be chosen at random. 

Never let any arbitrary factor influence your choice. E.g. 

If we are investigating opinion in a coalmine, do not choose 
the foremen, the first ten men to reach the pithead, the 
secretaries of the local union, your brother-in-law, or 
anybody distinguished by unrepresentative characteristics. 

c) Che sk ..f act r a ther . than opinion . 

People are not reliable guides to their own opinions. In 
fact, on matters not violently affecting personal advantage, 
most people tend to give either the answer they think you 
want or an answer that does them credit. People's actions 
are a more reliable guide to their opinions than their 
words. E.g. Don't ask people their opinion of R.A.F. 
leaflets. Find out whether they pass them on. 

d) Use of observation rather than questioning . 

What papers do people read? Where do they shop? Do they talk 
to Germans? Do they watch German newsreels? Do they listen 
to the B.B.C.? 






198 SOE SYLLABUS 


e) Avoid all hypothetical questions . 

Instead of asking "What would you have done if you had not 
joined the army?", ask "What work were you doing or applying 
for when you were called up?" 

f) Avoid all words of vague meaning . 

Words like "often", "much", "occasionally" tend to obscure 
facts rather than reveal them. They open the door to all 
kinds of wishful thinking and guesswork. 

g) Never try to prompt people . 

When it is difficult to get an opinion, there is a 
temptation to suggest one. This is a frequent source of 
error. No answer is better than a prompted answer; no 
information better than misleading information. 

6. FOR REPORTS, NEVER CONFUSE FACT WITH INTERPRETATION . 

Interpretation may be useful on occasion, but, when reporting, 
always distinguish clearly between fact and interpretation. 
Reports should read something like this: 

" Fact : X miners and Y railwaymen in Blanktown have volunteered 
for work in Germany within the last Z days. Miners give 
reasons A, B and C; railwaymen give reasons B, C and D. 

Interpjre.ta tion : 

On the basis of the above facts, my opinion is that 
Germany's attack on Russia has produced a marked swing 
towards collaboration among working-class circles in 
Blanktown." 

(Students are asked to criticize this report for errors or 
omissions.) 

On the basis of sound information, collected in the manner 
described above, the formulation of effective operational 
propaganda is facilitated. 

7. SECURITY PRECAUTIONS . 

a) F or mu lat ion of Que -S.tiQnS • 

Ideally all questions addressed to a group vis-a-vis an 
identical political fact should themselves be identical. 

With the principles enunciated above in mind, they should 
therefore be carefully phrased in such a manner that they 
can be slipped innocently into any conversation. 

If this is impossible for security reasons, take care to 
phrase all your questions so that the answers "add up". 









SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 199 


E.g. the answer "Yes" to one question would be useless when 
juxtaposed with the answer "On a Wednesday" to another 
question on the same subject. 

b) Behaviour. 

Apply methods of information-gathering listed under A.3. 
Sec. 3) b). 

Do not frequent too obviously certain areas or cultivate 
too obviously the members of a particular trade. 

It is possible to elicit information without appearing to 
ask for it, to overhear gossip in cafes and queues, to 
observe behaviour in the group affected. This is proved by 
the fact that people have done it.

PROPAGANDA PRESENTATION 

1. Fundamental Principles 


INTRODUCTION : 


Good advertising is based on set principles; good writing 
on deep feeling. Good propaganda needs both; and the good 
propagandist will use the latter to mask the former. 

The principles must never be allowed to "show through." We 
are not sending men back to Occupied Europe to sell soap. 

Nevertheless propaganda presentation must always 
conform to the following fundamental principles: 

1. Simplicity of : 

a) General Idea . 

Let each leaflet present but one General Idea - from which 
there should be no digression. 

b) Argument. 

In support of the General Idea one may produce Particular Ideas. 
These should be logically linked and linked so closely that the 
reader is unable to escape from climbing the rigid "mental 
stairway" that leads from an existing attitude to a required 
attitude. 

Such linking is most effective when it binds sentence to 
sentence (for examples, see Appendix A); but, where this is 
impossible, one should always link Particular Idea to 
Particular Idea. 

c) Language . 

Be simple, but never patronising. Do not speak as a scholar 
writing down to fishermen. Lower you mentality to that of a 
fishermen and write up. (For example, see Appendix B.) 

2. Concreteness . 

a) Avoid abstract words like the plague, because: 

i) Such words as "democracy", "patriotism", "freedom", have 
become platitudes without significance. 

ii) Even where abstracts are not yet platitudinous, they can 
never affect a reader's self-interest so powerfully as 
concrete words. E.g.:- 

- For "patriotism" say "Love of France." 












SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 201 


- For "hunger" say "empty bellies." 

- For "The Peace Loving Dutch nation are now resisting German 
oppression" say "The Dutch people, who once grew tulips and 
made cheese, are now stabbing Germans in the back." 

- For "Germany's death-rate is rising in Russia" say "German 
corpse is piled upon German corpse among the blood, the 
bone, the twisted tripes and scattered bowels of the 
Russian battlefield." 

b) In thus appealing to a reader's self-interest, recall that 
such self-interest is normally two-fold: 

(i) Selfish: "The Germans have taken away your cattle." 

(ii) Unselfish: "The Germans have enslaved France." 

The most powerful possible appeal is one directed towards a 
combination of selfish and unselfish elements, i.e. "Your 
cattle have been taken away because France is enslaved." 

3. Repetition . 

a) By this is meant the choice of one urgent, compelling General 
Idea, and the repetition of that idea from many different 
points of view and/or by many different methods - leaflet, 
broadcast, rumour, etc. 

b) By constant repetition we can be certain of securing: 

(i) A larger audience. 

(ii) If not a conviction, at least an effect on the mentality 
of the audience. Cf. Goebbels' anti-Semitic and anti- 
Czech. propaganda. This effect can often be strengthened 
into conviction by: 

4. Action . 

Action must always be recommended because: 

a) Action is the aim of all propaganda. 

b) Action drives home the persuasive lessons of repetitive 
propaganda - i.e. people will remember a propagandist's line 
of talk if they can associate it with an action in which they 
themselves have taken part, E.g. 

(i) Germans will remember Goebbels' anti-Semitic propaganda 
because they have seen, read of or taken part in Jewish 
persecutions. 

(ii) They will remember his anti-Czech propaganda because 
Germany won a "bloodless" victory over the Czechs. 

(iii) They do NOT remember Goebbels' anti-Italian propaganda 
in July 1934, because nothing was done about it.

PROPAGANDA PRESENTATION 

11. Mechanics 


INTRODUCTION ; 

The "hit-or-miss" author, who writes primarily to please 
himself and only incidentally to please his readers, is a vile 
propagandist. 

The propagandist writes solely with the intention of appealing 
to his readers' interest. He aims to hit, because he cannot 
afford to miss. 

Accordingly his work is based on the formulae of modern 
advertising, to whose task his own runs broadly parallel. 

It differs only in that the propagandist is at greater pains 
that the copywriter to disguise his medium. The reader of an 
advertisement should never be provoked into feeling: "This is 
only an advertisement." The reader of propaganda should, if 
possible, never be allowed even to suspect that he is reading 
propaganda. 

Before actually writing a leaflet, the propagandist must: 

A. Ask and answer the seven basic questions listed below. As a matter 
of self-discipline they should be asked and answered on paper. 

1. What General Idea am I trying to sell? 

Cf. C.3. No digression from single choice. 

Cf. Goebbels' brilliant choice of isolationism to 
U.S.A. 


2. To whom am I trying to sell it? 

Remember "groupings" in C.l. 

Cut out each word, phrase and sentence that does not 
appeal to your "target's" interest. 


3. Where am I sending my message? 

Depends on answer to 2. 

Knowledge of "social geography" showing where and 
therefore in what conditions a given group live. 

4. when must my message be delivered? 


News value. 









SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 203 


Seasonal factors. 

Anniversaries. 

5. Against what opposition? 

Where possible, anticipate enemy propaganda. 

Where impossible, counter evidence with better evidence 
- never with a flat denial, to which complete silence is 
preferable. 

6. From whom does my message come? 

In covert propaganda, preferably from nationals of the 
country concerned and from an organisation rather than 
an individual. 

7. How can my argument coming from (6) best convey the General 
Idea (1) in terms appealing to the self-interest of my 
audience (2) at (3) place, at (4) time and against (5) 
opposition? 

B. Determine that the message will do three things: 

1. Convince group that they should undertake required action. 

2. Convince group that they can undertake required action 

3. Convince group that required action justifies personal risks 
involved. 


To fulfil these three requirements, most appeals may be based on 
the following three elements: 

1. Statement of grievance. (We are in a mess.") 

2. Message of hope. ("But not too deeply.") 

3. Call to action. ("How to get out".) 

(See specimen leaflet - Appendix to this Lecture.) 

Note : More intelligent Students are now asked to write a leaflet 
on a set subject. On its completion they are provided with 
the following check list of questions: 

Content . 

1. Have I digressed from my General Idea? 

2. Does my "story" fit the facts, as I know them? 

Are the subdivisions of my "story" 

a) logical? 

b) in order? 

c) linked up? 


3 .

4. Have I made the most of: 

a) absolute news value? 

b) propaganda news value? (Propaganda news value - a new way

5. Have I related this news to the point I wish to make? 

6. Have I used, wherever possible , proof, evidence and 
examples? 

7. Have I made contact with the reader's personal self- 
interest? i.e. is it concrete? 

Style . 

1. Is my message 

a) clear? 

b) simple? 

c) unmistakable (no possible double meanings)? 

d) free of contradictions? 

e) concrete? 

2. Have I used 

a) short sentences? 

b) short paragraphs? 

c) liaison between paragraphs? 

d) enough sub-heads? 

Objective . 

Have I remembered that propaganda is designed to produce 
BEHAVIOUR (i.e. a state of mind or a line of action)? In 
other words, does my reader know clearly WHAT IS WANTED OF 
HIM?

REPRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION - 1 


April. 1943 


REPRODUCTION. 

A. Printing . 

Note : (i) It takes seven years to make a master-printer. Our aim 
has been to instruct propaganda-agents sufficiently in 
such basic knowledge of printing as will enable them to 
recruit an expert, appreciate his problems and even, to 
some extent, instruct him in clandestine printing to 
which he may be unaccustomed. 

(ii) In Occupied Countries our best work has been done by 
friendly printers working inside the print-shops of 
German controlled newspapers - often under the very 
noses of the Nazis. This because: 

- The Nazis have sacked all anti-collaborationist 
writers, but could not afford to sack printers. 

- Lack of metal, ink and paper supply is least felt in 
German-controlled newspapers. 

- Jobbing-printers are always more suspect and 
therefore under closer surveillance than newspaper 
printers. 

(iii) Our instruction therefore outlines the principal 

methods of overt newspaper-printing and adds advantages 
and/or disadvantages of each method from a covert point 
of view. 


1. Definit i o n- 

"The application of paper to an inked metal surface on which the 
message (reversed) stands in relief." 

Of the three elements - metal, ink and paper - that go to make 
any printing operation, it is proposed to discuss only the metal 
and the paper. 


2. Metal . 


a) Type 

(i) MONOTYPE, cast in single letters; assembled by machine or 
by hand in "stick"; completed message locked in 
framework consisting of metal "chase" and held 
in position by "furniture" and "quoins" - whole 
called the "form". 









208 SOE SYLLABUS 


- Can "accidentally" be dropped or "pied" to avoid 
detection. 

- Is difficult to transport covertly from one 
department to another or out of the printshop. 

(ii) LINOTYPE, cast in single lines; each line produced 
mechanically and assembled by hand as for 
monotype. 

- Can "accidentally" be dropped, to avoid detection, 
into molten-lead container that is part of every 
linotype machine. 

- Can easily be transported from one department to 
another or outside the print-shop, distributed in 
the pockets or on the person of a courier, the lines 
being arranged in the correct order either by 
friendly compositor inside the print-shop or by safe 
jobbing printer or propaganda-agent with own plant 
outside. 

- Can be "run-in" secretly alongside innocent work. 
E.g. a linotype-operator could easily set, say, 
seven lines of "Gringoire" under surveillance and 
then, when head printer's back was turned, one line 
of a subversive leaflet. 

(Examples of Monotype and Linotype are shown.) 

b) Blocks• 

A picture transferred by a photographic process on to a single 
sensitized metal plate so that the image (reversed) stands in 
relief. 

The picture, known as the "original", may have been drawn, 
painted, typewritten or printed. 

Two main types of block: 

(i) Line-Block: Made of zinc, reproduces plain black and 
white. 

(ii) Half-tone : Made of copper, reproduces with tone - 
gradations like a photograph. 

Line-block is easier to produce covertly and more suited to 
leaflet reproduction than half-tone. 

Specimens of line-block ("zinco") in the making are exhibited: 

- Original 

- Negative 

- Print

- Matrix or mould (to facilitate covert distribution) 

- Mounted stereo 

- Proofs 

Remember two security advantages: 

(i) Blockmakers work in separate department less surveyed by 
head printer. 

(ii) They can diminish an "original" to a size that makes it 
easy to distribute, easy to hide and still easy to read. 

3. Paper . 

a) "Wove" - dried, after manufacture, on felt. 

b) "Laid" - dried, after manufacture, on ribbed screen. 

"Wove" is difficult to track back to source; "Laid" easy, owing 
to individual dimensions of screen. Make for national newsprint, 
where possible, and avoid watermarks. 

B. Commercial Duplicator . 

1. Safer and more accessible but less authoritative than 
printing. 

2. Impossible to trace back duplicated tract to individual 
duplicating machine. Other security factors permitting, one 
may therefore "borrow" someone else's machine. 

3. Use Gestetner or Roneo machines where possible. 

4. Use only absorbent or semi-absorbent paper. 

5. If inexpert and unable to enrol aid of expert, practise on 
innocent occasions. Unskilled work liable to make one 
conspicuously dirty. 

6. Remember noise-factor. 

7. Care in choice of typewriter, (see below.) 

C. Typewriter . 

Duplicated work cannot be traced back to a duplicator, but can be 
traced to an individual typewriter. Therefore consider the 
following security precautions: 

1. Only use your typewriter for secret work. Never "borrow" 
anyone else's. Hide it when not in use. This a golden rule. 

The rest are subsidiary precautions. 




210 SOE SYLLABUS 


2. To avoid detection through damaged letters, use newish machine 
and consider possibility of alternately cleaning and dirtying 
keys for alternate leaflets. 

3. Never use new ribbon for secret work. 

4. When making line-block from typewritten "original", use 
carbon-copy for "original". This blurs the outline of damaged 
letters and makes detection more difficult.

REPRODUCTION AMD DISTRIBUTION - II 


APRIL, 1943 

0=6 


METHODS COMBINING REPRODUCTION AND DIS T RI BU TION 

A, Chain Letter 

1. Difficulty of addressing specific group; therefore stick to 
straight news. 

2. Overcome recipient's laziness by keeping letters short (5 or 6 
censored news-items sufficient) and legible. 

3. If mechanically reproduced, add handwritten personal message 
and signature. 

4. Evidence of effectiveness from German counter-measures. 


B. "Toys" 

1. Chalk 

Should always be carried, provided owner has good cover. E.g. 
tailor, shopkeeper, teacher, pupil. 

2. Stickers... 

Notch, if regular shape, to ensure applying it right way up in 
dark. Observe "sticker drill", (demonstrated.) 

3. Stencils. 

Notch, as for stickers. 

All above should be employed in black-out, and are especially 
valuable for: 

(a) Defacing enemy propaganda. 

(b) Bitter, purposive ridicule (cf. "Gringoire" &amp; Salengro.) 

(c) Decoy propaganda. (Meaningless signs, etc.) 

C. Rumour 

Specialist method on no account to be lightly used owing to risks 
of confusion and (propaganda's most heinous sin) contradiction. 
Essentials are: 


1. GOOD ORGANISATION 


(a) Authorative source obeyed with discipline 












212 SOE SYLLABUS 


(b) Source must not be known to actual "whisperers". 

(c) "Whisperers" must not be known to each other. 

2. GOOD DIRECTIVES 

(a) Rumours must have specific objectives. 

(b) Rumours must be easy to believe and difficult to dismiss. 

(c) Rumours must be concrete and precise, never abstract or 
vague. 

(d) Curious exception of religious and superstitious rumours. 

3. GOOD D I SS EMINAT ION 

(a) Try never to talk more than once yourself. Make others 
talk. Arrange for innocent interception of your "sib" on 
fertile ground e.g. garrulous barber, gossipy barmaid, 
Spanish Ambassador. 

(b) "Jetsam" method of dropping provocative letters or parts 
of letters, which contain libels, calumnies and rumours, 
in places where recipients will find them when they are 
alone - e.g. railway-carriage at beginning of a journey, 
telephone-boxes, public lavatories. 

DISTRIBUTION 

A. BY H &amp;NI ? 

1. XDdfrest: 

(a) Through boites-aux-lettres and accommodation addresses. 

(b) Through insertion of leaflets between leaves of books and 
newspapers in public libraries. 

2. Direct 

(a) Never appear to be carrying more than one leaflet. You 
came on it by chance or it was passed you by someone you 
don't know - i.e. never be recognizable as "a 
distributor." 

(b) Fold leaflet, before distributing, so that recipient (if 
subsequently interrogated) may say he received it through 
the post. (See B.l. below) 

B. BY POST 


1. Safe method for recipient of leaflet who can only be penalised 
for retention or distribution - not for actual reception. 









SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 213 


. Safe method for sender, provided he takes following 

precautions: 

(a) Check whether you are being followed to mail-box (see 
A.8). 

(b) If you always use the sane mail-box, there is no need 
to follow you. Therefore post in various boxes at 
varying times. 

(c) In large town, best time is commercial mailing-time, 
(cover for carrying large number of identical envelopes 
and little fear of talk from postman). 

(d) In small locality, break up appearance of mail by never 
having more than two or three letters in the same 
handwriting, in the same envelope or bearing the same 
arrangement of stamps, etc. in the same box.

BASIC PLAN OF ALLIED PROPAGANDA TO OCCUPIED COUNTRIES 

I. INTRODUCTORY. 

A. AUiesL O J5qeaLi y .es 

1. To unite Ruritanians in a common hatred of the Hun. 

2. To encourage non-cooperation. 

3. To encourage passive resistance. 

4. To encourage undetectable sabotage. 

5. To prepare every Ruritanian for D-day. 

B. Allied Platforms.- 

In order to attain these objectives, Allied propaganda falls 
under five main headings: 

1. The certainty of Allied victory. 

2. Hatred of the German. 

3. Ruritania's future assured by Allied victory. 

4. Ruritania fights on. 

5. How Ruritania can help hasten victory. 

These headings remain constant; but the emphasis on each may 
change, as must also the themes and evidence grouped under 
each heading. 

II. THE PLAN. 

a. certainty. &lt; ? £_Allied Vi stogy. 

Emphasis on this heading, strong until 1942, decreases daily 
as certainty of Allied victory grows more axiomatic. 

1. Comparison of Potential . 

Object of such comparison in two-fold: 

— By showing Allied Superiority, to strengthen belief in 
certainty of Allied Victory. (But only link "potential" 
talk to actual Allied successes.) 

— By showing specific Axis inferiority, to encourage attack 
by friendly elements of enemy in occupied territory. 

a) War-industrial potential. 

b) Man-power potential. 

c) Food Potential. (Emphasis at present off comparison. See 
"Ruritania's Future". 


d) Transport Potential. 












SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 215 


2. Strategy . 

We are concerned with three broad strategic themes: 

a) "Germany is the main enemy." 

Once Germany is defeated we can concentrate on Japan. 

Cf. Roosevelt-Churchill discussions. 

b) " Unconditional Surrender." 

Cf. Casablanca communique. 

c) "The Last Lap," 

Emphasis on "last" and off length of "Lap". 

B. Hatred of the German. 

Today primarily a "unifying" theme. (See objectives: I. A. 1.) 

1. Expose German "Divide and Rule" policy. 

2. Expose Germany's present tendency to conciliate Ruritania. 
Despite isolated acts and frequent promises of kindness due 
to: 

a) Germany's pre-occupation with Russian war and defence of 
"Festung Europa"; 

b) Germany's need for Ruritanian economic collaboration; 

c) German's fear of Ruritanian hostility. 

Nazidom's real aims are: 

a) De-education. 

b) De-industrialisation. 

c) De-population. 

- Recruitment of Ruritanian workers. 

- Colonization schemes to shift and split population. 

- Retention of prisoners-of-war. 

C. R uritania's Fyture Assured b y Al lied Victory . 

1. Written commitments. 

2. Oral commitments. 

3. Safe-guard through Emigre Governments. 

4. Allied interests. 

- "Allies need a stronger Ruritania to help keep Germany in

CODES AND CIPHERS 


1. PURPOSE . 

a) That a message should be capable of being understood by 
the addressee, and not by the enemy. 

b) That the enemy should not realize that a secret 
communication is being passed. As suspicious to send a 
wire containing the group "BXGCT" as one saying "BLOW UP 
THE BRIDGE". 

Note : In all countries there exists a censorship which is 
very thorough for messages leaving the country, and more 
haphazard for messages passing within the country. To beat 
the censorship would be a fair summary of the object of most 
secret writings. 

2. WHEN USED. 

Codes and Ciphers may be necessary whenever it is desired to 

communicate in writing, e.g.: 

- By post, internally or externally. 

- By courier carrying a message or plan. 

- By carrier pigeon. 

- By telegraph. 

- By advertisements in the press. 

3. ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS. 

a) The Need for Security . 

- Discovery of coded documents or secret ink 
preparations place possessor in a very suspicious 
position. Code systems and inks taught have been 
deliberately selected in order to reduce this risk to 
a minimum. 

- Essential to destroy all paper used in enciphering or 
deciphering messages, and all materials used in 
writing or reading a message in secret ink. 

- Do not keep a written note of any code arrangements 
unless absolutely unavoidable. 

b) The Need for Secrecy. 

- No one except the actual correspondents should know the 
system, keywords or ink used. 

- An organizer could make different arrangements with 
each member of his organization. He would know all the 
systems, but each member should know no other them his 
own. 










SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 219 


c) The Need for Care . 

- One error may result in the message being 
indecipherable. 

- General carelessness may arouse suspicion in the mind 
of the censor. 

d) The Need for Concealment . 

- As stated above, the fact that a secret message is 
passing must be concealed from the enemy. This will 
usually be done by the code system itself. But special 
papers may help a person carrying a message to conceal 
it. (Exhibits.) Practise writing on thin paper. 

4. CODES AND CIPHERS . 

For the purposes of our work, codes and ciphers may be 
distinguished as follows: 

A code is a method of concealing a message in such a way as 
to make it appear innocent. 

A cipher is a method of converting a message into symbols 
which do not appear innocent, and which have no meaning to 
a person not possessing the key. 

The following varieties of codes and ciphers will be explained: 

- Simple code words. 

- Innocent letter codes. 

- Playfair substitution cipher. 

- Double transposition cipher. 

5. SIMPLE W QRP CO D E S- 

a) General. 

A simple word code is the arrangement by conventions of 
certain words or phrases to mean other words or phrases. 
Only a limited variety of messages can be sent by such a 
code as this. 

b) When used. 

- Telegraph. 

- Telephone. 

- Personal advertisements. 

c) Examples . 

- In a Telegram . 


NO NEWS RECEIVED FOR AGES ARE YOU WELL 

might be agreed upon to mean 

CARRY ON WITH THE SCHEME AS ARRANGED. 












220 SOE SYLLABUS 


- On the Telephone . 

Heavily veiled and guarded language would usually be 
sufficient, such as "usual time and place"; but code 
names can also be used, e.g. the word "cat" can be a word 
of warning that a third person has just entered the room. 

- In a Personal Advertisement . 

"Gold ring lost in Cafe de la Paiz, night of 24 Sept; 
if found, please return to 6 Rue de la Croix." might be 
a general warning to all members not to visit the 
organizer until further notice. 

6. INNOCENT LETTER CODES . 

a) General . 

A code which is concealed within a communication which 
looks completely innocent. 

b) Wh e n,us ed . 

To send a message through the post within the country 
and from the field to headquarters. 

c) Particular. M ethod■ 

See D.3. 

7. PLAYFAIR . CIP HER. 

a) General • 

A substitution cipher in itself easily susceptible of 
solution. 

b) When used . 

To conceal a message in clear which is itself to be 
concealed in an innocent letter. The combination 
intensely difficult to break. 

c) Particular method . 

See D.2. 

8. DOUB L E-.TR ANSPOSITION CIPHER . 

a) General . 

- A "straight" cipher, i.e. a cipher that looks like a 
cipher. 

- Very secure if proper precautions taken. 














SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 221 


b) When used . 

- Transmission by W/T. 

- Message carried by courier. 

- Used in conjunction with invisible ink, 
post. 

- As a military cipher in the event of an 

c) Particular method . 

- See D.4. 


e.g. through 
armed rising.

PLAYFAIR CIPHER 

This cipher, first used during the 1914-1918 war, combines 
comparative security with great simplicity. It is based on a square 
grille, containing 25 cells. 

A key work or phrase containing at least eight different letters is 
memorized. This key word is then written into the square. Any 
letters which recur are omitted. 

Example ; Key work - BALKAN SOBRANIE 


B 

A 

L 

K 

N 

S 

0 

R 

I 

E 

















The remaining letters of the alphabet are then written in to 
complete the cage. 


As we have only 25 squares, one letter has either to be suppressed 
or combined with another.

To Encipher . 

Divide the message to be enciphered into groups of two letters, 

E.g. ARRIVE CHARING CROSS AT FIVE. 

AR RI VE CH AR IN GC RO SS AT FI VE. 

When the same letter occurs twice in a group as above, 'SS', the two 
letters must be separated by a null or dud letter, which has 
previously been selected for this purpose. When one letter is left 
over at the end of the message, the group is made up by adding a 
further dud letter. 

Example : AR RI VE CH AR IN GC RO SX SA TF IV EX 

There are now three possible ways in which a pair of letters may 
occur in the square - on the same horizontal line, in the same 
vertical column, as opposite corners of a rectangle.

NOTE: Always start from the same level as the first letter of 
the group. 

4. Encyphered message reads: LOESZSDCLOEKHDIR . . . etc. 

NOTE: i) Figures should be replaced by letters on an agreed 
system. 

Example: A - 1 

B - 2 


ABCDEFGHIO 

1234567890 

It may be necessary at times to preface these letters by 
"FIG" or some such sign to indicate figures are 
encyphered. 

ii) Punctuation should be used to make the sense of the 
message clear. STOP is the only point necessary and 
should be spelt in full. 

iii) In order to mix the letters round in the square a 
keyword including two of the letters "U V W X Y Z" 
would be suitable: 






























SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 225 


5. To decypher . 

a) Take the Keyword and complete the square, omitting the 
agreed letter. 

b) Divide the cipher message into pairs. 

c) Substitute the pairs into the square, performing the 
reverse movements to encipherment, i.e.: 

i) HQ.Eiz op _t. al Line . Move to LEFT, 

ii) Ver ti cal L ing. Move UP. 

iii) Opposite Corners of Rectangle . Take the OTHER diagonal. 

6. Conclusion . 

This cipher should only be used for short messages. 

When combined with the Rimmer System in an 'Innocent Letter' code 
it is of high security. 








226 SOE SYLLABUS

INNOCENT TEXT LETTER 


1. DESCRIPTION . 

A method of concealing an encyphered message (e.g. Playfair) in a 
letter whose appearance is entirely innocent. 

2. METHOD ■ 

a) Plot a skeleton of the proposed letter including, at the 
appropriate interval, the letters of the encyphered message, 
thus: 


L 



0 



E 



S etc. 


b) Using the letters of the encyphered message as the initial 
letters of your innocent text letter, write in a letter with 
an innocent meaning, thus: 


Let's 

all 

go 

Out 

together 

on 

Easter |Sunday 

as 

Soon 

as etc. 


3. CONVENTIONS . 

The following conventions must be previously arranged: 

a) Indicator to show letter conceals a secret message - e.g. 
date, address, signature, courtesy form. 

b) Position of beginning of message - e.g. at beginning of 2nd 
para., 3rd word in 3rd line. ("Numerical" convention 
recommended.) 

c) Interval at which "pregnant" words occur. 

d) Treatment of hyphenated and apostrophized words as one or two 
words. 

e) Treatment (if necessary) of X's - e.g. use "pregnant" words 
beginning with "ex". 

f) Position of end of message - e.g. at a special word, phrase, 
point of punctuation. ("Numerical" convention NOT 
recommended.) 

NOTE: Where possible, simplify conventions for easy memorization. 
E.g. word interval of 2; message begins at 2nd line of 2nd 
para., hyphenated and apostrophised words are two words. 



























SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 227 


4. CONTENT. SUBJECT MATTER AND STYLE . 

In the light of recent information obtained from our censorship 
the following points should be noted in connection with the 
preparation of a letter containing an encyphered message: 

a) CONTENT . 

i) Sender's Address ■ 

Often it will not be necessary to put your full address at 
the top of the letter - e.g. in France, when writing from 
one town to another, it is sufficient to put the name of 
the town together with the date. When writing abroad it is 
usually necessary to put the address at the top of the 
letter and on the flap of the envelope outside. 

The address should never be you own (unless this is 
unavoidable) and either a fictitious address, or that of a 
Quisling, should be used. 

Business letters should always be sent on paper headed 
with a printed letter-head. 

ii) courtes y ..F qct- 

Our censorship inform us that letters beginning with 
expressions such as "Dear Friend" are usually regarded 
with some suspicion. Consequently a vague opening phrase 
of this type should be avoided, as the same practice will 
probably be observed by the enemy censorship. 

b) SUB JE CT M ATT E R. 

i) Theme ■ 

It is difficult to lay down definite rules as to what 
should be included. Certainly one should avoid harping on 
the same theme throughout the whole letter. A happy medium 
of length should be sought. Letters which are too short 
will attract attention on this account. The actual facts 
and names mentioned in the letter should all be ones which 
can be substantiated fairly easily. If the writer of the 
letter actually gives his name and address, he should be 
in the possession of good reasons for and proofs of 
everything he states. It would be advisable to avoid vague 
hintings and generally woolly references to things 
"understood between us". 

ii) Consistency . 

In order that letters may be produced which have some 
semblance of reality, it is as well for the student to 
write a cover address always in the same manner. One is 
not always in the position to tell whether the 








228 SOE SYLLABUS 


correspondence is being watched by the censorship or not, 
and consistency in style and subject-matter will carry 
more conviction to the reader. It is suggested that the 
student selects a person whom he actually knows in real 
life and addresses his letters to him - talking about the 
things which they have in common and in the style he 
actually would use in real life. If all the letters are 
dealt with in this way, there should be no reason for 
suspicion to be aroused. (What actually happens in 
practice is that one time a student sends to his cover 
address a business letter, the next time a love letter, 
and the next time an appointment for a visit in the 
holidays. If the censorship were watching such 
correspondence, the hand-writing would be recognized and 
suspicion definitely aroused.) 


C) STYLE . 


i) Consistency . 

The style throughout the letter must remain consistent. It 
is no use having a flowing style at the beginning, a 
staccato style throughout the part where the secret 
message is hidden, and once more a flowing style at the 
end. 

ii) Cover . 

The tone must fit in with the general cover, the 
addresses, etc. 

iii) Punctuation . 

It is as well to avoid exaggerated punctuation. Censors 
are always on the look-out for semaphore and morse symbols 
in the punctuation of letters, and, consequently, if 
punctuation is used to denote the beginning or ending of a 
message, it should be recorded as delicately as possible. 

iv) Capital letters. 

Capital letters - proper names can be used, but not 
excessively, and not only at the beginning of pregnant words. 

v) Difficult letters . 

Often the message to be sent in the text will be 
encyphered on a system such as Playfair, Multi-Alphabet, 
Switch, etc. and certain difficult letters from the point 
of view of camouflage will have to be dealt with. If the 
cipher message contains too many of these, the text will 
be much influenced by the difficulty of inserting them in 
an innocent manner. Should such a difficulty arise, it 
would be far better to re-cast the message in a fresh form 
to avoid the occurrence of these letters. 







SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 229 


D. 4 ■ 

October 1943 


This method is suitable for long messages but not more than 200 
letters should be sent at a time. If a message of greater length has 
to be sent it should be divided into several parts and it is 
advisable to have means of numbering these, either internally or in 
the preamble of your messages, to differentiate between them. 

1. KEY WORDS . 

These should be from 8-20 letters in length and it should be 
arranged that there is no identity of idea between the first and 
second key word, i.e. fish and chips, Tottenham Hotspur, etc. 

The key words are of no value in themselves but act as a mnemonic. 
Any series of letters would serve, as the key is derived from the 
jumbled order they would give alphabetically, i.e.: 

ELEMENTAR Y 
253647918 10 

CR YP TANAL YSI S 
3 8 12 7 11 1 6 2 5 13 9 4 10 

Take the first key word (Elementary). Vertical columns are 
dropped for each letter and the message is then written across 
the columns: 


E 

L 

E 

M 

E 

N 

T 

A

Care should be taken to leave the cage irregular. Count the 
number of letters. 

NOTE : i) It may be necessary to use punctuation in order to 

make the sense clear. Only "stop" (or "comma") are 
used and these should be spelt in full. 

ii) It would be insecure to use figures in the 

transposition as they would give clues to sequence 
of letters. A simple letter substitution should be 





















230 SOE SYLLABUS 


adopted, e.g.: 


ABCDEFGHIJ 

1234567890 


iii) If the message gives a regular cage extra letters 
which have no meaning can be added to make an 
additional partial line. Pick the letters 
vertically from the columns in the order indicated 
by the figures indicated at the head of the 
columns:

The resulting series is known as a "single" or "simple" 
transposition cipher. 

The security of the system depends, however, on a further 
transposition. 

Take the second key word , number it alphabetically and drop 
perpendiculars. Write the letter of the simple transposition 
across the columns as if they were a clear message:

Once more pick the number of letters vertically from the columns 
in the order indicated by the numbers at the head of the columns. 
Check to see that no letters have been lost or added en route. 

The resulting double transposition is the message to be 
transmitted. It is usual to divide the letters into groups of 
five, e.g.: 


TNTUR IMNZE FCWAE RVFRR SAYGN BAOID EEOHO HO 

The security of double transposition messages is in direct 
proportion to their length, thus it is not suitable to transmit 
or even hide in an innocent letter short messages enciphered on 
this system. They are a prey for anagramming. 

NOTE : If several messages are being enciphered on the same 

pair of keys and sent on the same day or soon after, it 
is a safety precaution to confine messages to within 10 
























SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 231 


letters either way of each other, i.e. a message of 80 
letters long should not be sent with one from 70-90 
letters in length. 

2. TO DECIPHER . 

If one remembers that this process is merely the reverse of the 
encipherment, no difficulties should be encountered. At each 
stage one has to do the opposite to the encipherment, thus: 

i) Take the second key word (the one last used) and number 
it. 

ii) It will be necessary to reconstruct the complete cage, as 
the depth of the columns cannot be determined otherwise. 
Divide the number of letters in the message by the number 
of columns given by the key word. This will give the 
number of columns deep, and any remainder will be an extra 
column on the left hand side of the cage, i.e. 37 divided 
by 13 = 2 and 11 over:

Replace the letters vertically into the columns in the 
order indicated by the key. 

The cage when completely filled will correspond to the 
first transposition written as a message on the grille 
formed by the second key word. Calculate in the same 
manner the correct cage on the key given by the first key 
word. Reading off the letters horizontally ■ replace them 
vertically into the cage, e.g.

The result will give the message.

3. £H ftNGINg _ THE KEY WQRD . 

In order that key lengths and column order may vary as much as 
possible, a precaution against the cryptographer, a system can be 
employed of using several sequences, e.g.: 

i) Memorization of a poem or a given piece of text from 
which certain passages are chosen. An indicator group 
would be necessary to show what the keys were. 

ii) The correspondents make their keys from two identical 

copies of a book, e.g. page 149, omit first 5 words, line 

20 . 


Let us assume the constant is the five words per line 
omitted. The rest of the words on the line would give 
keys of varying length. In this particular instance the 
indicator group would be 14920. This can be disguised by 
adding a personal number, for example:

SECRET INKS 


The serious use of secret inks is generally confined to war or 
preparations for war and bound up with the inevitable accompaniment 
of intrigue and espionage. Such inks are also used by criminal gangs 
and secret organizations for personal correspondence, but the inks 
and methods are generally primitive, because the object is rather to 
correspond while eluding curiosity than to get information or 
messages through an active and watchful censorship. The criminal or 
seditionist is rarely a chemist and relies on well tried inks, the 
secrecy of the mails and general avoidance of suspicion rather than 
on elaborate formulas. 

In war the mails cease to be secret, but an agent can still get away 
with the use of primitive inks, if he uses them carefully and is 
careful to avoid arousing suspicion as to the letter or its address. 

Secret inks of the simple order such as lemon juice have long been 
known, but the modern high grade ink is almost entirely a product of 
the interest caused by the World War. From the time of the 
development of chemistry and especially organic chemistry (say 1860- 
80) to 1914 the wars fought were all short, none much over a year's 
duration, or between powers not possessing high technical skill, 
e.g. the Boers. In these cases the old inks continued to be used, 
which depended on simple well known colour reactions such as:- 

Iron Alum ^potassium ferrocyanide or thiocyante (reversible) 
Lead acedate - ammonium sulphide - starch - iodine, or on the 
application of heat to natural liquids such as milk, fruit juice or 
wine. 

Early in the World War these methods were still used, both sides 
expecting an early victory and enemy agents were caught in England 
using lemon juice and potassium ferrocyanide. 

As a stalemate set in and a long war became probable such things 
were no longer good enough and both sides set out to improve upon 
them. The Germans, it must be admitted, with their dominance in the 
fine chemical trade and superiority in skilled men set the pace 
until near the end of the War, with the Allies striving to catch up. 

The Germans concentrated first on simple drugs, which could be 
carried without incurring suspicion. Antipyrin, aminpyrine and 
phenacetine, the bases of many headache and anti-fever powders, 
served them well. However, developers were soon found as the Allies 
gained experience and the best of simple medicinal or household 
articles available as secret inks became exhausted. Substances which 
had no common use, and which were thus ipso facto incriminating, 
then came into use and were supplied to agents concealed in hollow 
soap cakes, dentifrice tubes, hollowed places in hair brushes, 
shaving sticks and so on. Later, with the increasing concentration 
on the subject the Germans succeeded in giving their agents 





SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 235 


impregnated articles of clothing, socks, ties, etc. with 
instructions to soak the article in water for a given time, to 
obtain ink. The agents were usually quite ignorant of the nature of 
the inks even of their development. Similar methods of concealing 
inks are still used. The Germans later used colloidal silver, 
carried as pin head tablets easily hidden. This had to be developed 
like a photograph. Silver protein, sold as an antiseptic under 
various names, was a similar ink. 

Both sides worked to find a universal developer, which would reveal 
all secret writing, whatever the ink. In 1917 the Allies hit on 
iodine, as a vapour or a special solution, in a wooden, glass 
fronted box, filled with iodine vapour by warming a few crystals in 
the base, the iodine attached itself to the writing which became 
clearly visible, brown in colour. When the message had been read or 
photographed, exposure to sunlight or sulphur dioxide gas, bleached 
it. The solution brushed on and later bleached with "hypo" solution 
behaved similarly. Thus messages could be tapped and sent on which 
is usually necessary to avoid alarming the enemy and shutting down 
on a line of communications. 

Soon after Allied chemists made this discovery, it was found no 
longer to work on some documents where secret ink was known to 
exist; the enemy had devised a counter. The iodine test depended on 
no chemical reaction but on the disturbance to the sizing and fibres 
of paper always caused by water, and which is unavoidable with any 
ink. It could and did develop writing made with pure distilled 
water. The obvious counter was to disturb the paper structure 
equally all over, by damping. This was done by steaming, or swabbing 
with water. (This of course would not avail where the ink reacted 
chemically with iodine, such as tin chloride or reducing agents in 
general). 

With the war development, highly secret and elaborate inks were 
introduced and as with codes and cyphers each side had to learn to 
read its enemy's inks and devise new ones which would baffle the 
enemy. The former especially was technically most difficult; a new 
ink had to be analized, which was a job requiring great skill and 
patience, considering the minute quantities of chemical available, 
and a developer predicted from the analysis, where possible, and 
worked out as to conditions or else discovered by trial and error. 

Shortly after the war ultra violet rays were discovered as an aid in 
detecting falsifications, such as note and bond forgeries, and the 
mercury vapour lamp used for such purposes proved a valuable aid in 
the secret ink field. 

Other than sound waves, the most important waves known are the 
electromagnetic waves. These are independent of air, and can be 
transmitted through a vacuum which sound cannot. These waves vary 
widely in their properties and their impact on the life of mankind, 
and apparently the sole factor determining the various kinds of 
electromagnetic waves is the wave length 



236 SOE SYLLABUS 



which may vary from a foot to a mile or more for the Herzian or 
wireless waves, down to distances comparable to the size of an atom 
or about one hundred-millionth of an inch (the finest X rays and 
radium rays). 

The light rays are a tiny band on this huge range of variation, from 
the violet rays (wavelength about .00002 inch, to the red rays 
(about .00004 inch). Rays longer than this are the infra red or heat 
rays and waves a little shorter are the violet rays, both of which 
are invisible, but so resembling light in other rays so as to give 
to ultra-violet rays the popular name "Black Light". 

Many substances have the power of absorbing such rays and emitting 
the energy as longer wave length, light or visible light. This 
property is called "Luminescence". If the substance can "store up" 
the rays, and emit when the stimulation has ceased, it is 
"phosphorescence". If emission takes place only while the 
stimulating rays are being received it is "fluorescence". The 
luminous paint on watches is phosphorescence. Fluorescence is seldom 
seen in ordinary life, since it is caused by sun or cure light, but 
at the same time masked. 

Examples of fluorescence are shown by motor oil, olive oil, quinine 
and many dyes. The fluorescence colour bears no relation to the 
ordinary colour and in fact is rarely exactly the same, e.g. motor 
oil (blue-green), rhodamine a crimson dye (salmon pink), leaves 
(crimson). 

Many secret inks are easily detectable under the mercury lamp, which 
contains a filter absorbing nearly all visible light which might 
mask the effect and passing only a faint purple glow, as well as 
black light. Paper usually has a mauve fluorescence. Gums on 
envelopes appear blush white. Human skin and teeth fluorescence. 

A secret writing might appear either fluorescent, or by absorbing 
the black light which makes the paper fluorescent, it appears 
darker. Yellowish compounds especially do this. Damping is no 
precaution against this test, which leaves no traces on the paper. A 
record can be kept by photographing the writing under the rays. 

Often the lamp will show that writing exists without showing it 
legibly. Other means must be found to read the writing. 

After the foregoing summary it is necessary to consider secret inks 
in more detail:- 

The essential properties for a secret ink, apart from the fact that 
it must be invisible and capable of being developed, are:- 

1. It must be sufficiently soluble in water. 


SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 237 


2. It must be non-volatile, with no pronounced smell (obviously 
menthol or camphor would not do). 

3. It must deposit no crystals on the paper, and be invisible in 
glancing light. 

4. It should not be visible under ultra-violet light. 

5. It must not decompose or rot or colour the paper (silver nitrate 
slowly turns black on paper or cloth and is used in marking ink). 

6. It should not react chemically with iodine or any other of the 
usual developers. 

7. The developers for it should be as few as possible. 

8. It should not develop under heat. 

9. If possible it should be obtainable by laymen without difficulty 
and should therefore have at least one innocent use. 

An ink complying with all these conditions would be a valuable 
acquisition. In practice (6) is nearly always incompatible with (9), 
since nearly all common chemicals usable as inks have known 
developers. Mixed chemicals are rare as inks since this increases 
the number of developers, but mixtures having properties absent in 
the various constituents are useful. 

Secret inks fall into two classes. Dealing first with class B:- 

B. Animal secretions, natural or semi-natural liquids - saliva, 
urine, seminal fluid, lemon or any fruit juice, wine, dissolved 
gum or mucilage, milk, diluted white of egg, soap suds, porridge 
fluid, diluted blood or blood serum. 

These are the oldest, simplest and most easily detected secret inks 
known. None of them would pass a competent testing station. Urine, 
saliva (usually), seminal fluid, wine, gum, all show in ultra violet 
rays; fruit juices, milk, egg-white, wine, saliva, urine, porridge 
fluid and soap suds are revealed by heat. 

Diluted blood requires a special test and is certainly the best of 
the group (blood clots on standing, leave a clear straw coloured 
serum, dilute this about one in ten). 

In spite of the insecurity of these inks they were valuable for 
their ready availability, for use within a country. The human 
secretions are much used by prisoners. Even water can be used if 
the message is not damped. But where any censorship has to be 
passed, they should only be used if nothing else is available and 
the risk of detection has to be taken, and obviously not for close 
secrets. 

A. The inks in Class A consist of chemicals (in the usual sense) of 
all kinds, from simple (and unsafe) inks like alum and potassium 


238 SOE SYLLABUS 


ferrocyanide, ferric alum, gallic acid, lead acetate, etc. to 
the most modern and secret high-grade inks. 

A further sub-classification is necessary. 

A "high-grade" ink may be defined as one which no foreign power can 
read. It is always a closely guarded secret. When a foreign power 
discovers the secret, the ink ceases to be high grade, but it may be 
used for work in technically more backward countries, or for less 
important work. Thus we arrive at a natural classification:- 

1. High grade inks as defined above. 

2. Inks of secret composition, no longer high grade. 

3. Other chemical inks, of which the composition and the developer 
are known generally to those concerned, in all nations. These 
like class B, are unsafe where vigilant censorship is to be 
feared, and the considerations mentioned in Class B, generally 
apply. 

It is now useful to consider the question from the censor's point of 
view. 

A document is received for testing with the possibility of secret 
ink being present. The chemist examines the surface in glancing 
light for any unevenness in the surface or any grease or wax marks. 
Then it is examined in strong light with a lens, for any 
irregularities. The visible ink writing is examined for any blurring 
or streaking, for any hints as to treatment (e.g. the word "heat" or 
any marks which would inform the receiver of the presence of a 
hidden message. Any wrinkling or cockling of the paper due to 
careless damping would arouse instant suspicion. 

The paper is next examined in filtered ultra-violet light, and with 
iodine vapour, and any other means, which can be used without 
altering the appearance of the document such as ammonia fumes for 
phenolphthalein (commonly sold as a laxative, turns magenta when 
exposed to alkali). 

Obviously for the censor, it is seven-eighths of the battle to know 
that a secret message is there. He will then do everything in his 
power to read it, taking days if necessary and using every known 
means and resource. Otherwise, if the writing and damping are well 
done, an ink which is at least safe against the foregoing tests is 
used and there are no outside grounds for suspicion, it is probable 
that the examination will be carried no farther and the letter 
allowed to pass. Heating to the charring point is left till last, as 
a rule, but heating below 175°C (350°F) may be tried without leaving 
traces. 

For invisible ink writing clearly the ink is important but hardly 
less important is the writing surface, usually paper. The use of 
cloth, garments etc. for secret writing must never be overlooked, as 
it avoids some of the troubles of paper, but such use for regular 


SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 239 


messages through the mails is difficult without arousing suspicion. 
Where the clothes are worn, or carried in luggage over a frontier, 
this is useful for long messages, which could not be memorized 
without great difficulty. Invisible ink has been used on a person's 
skin and developed by sitting before a fire, but such methods are 
not generally possible. A resourceful agent can profitably devise 
new variants of them, if he understands the new conditions involved, 
but for secret ink the medium in 90% of cases is paper. 

This must never be a glazed paper, far less any kind of coated art 
paper with heavy sizing, which reveals at once when viewed in 
glancing light, the presence of a message. Also it should not be 
ruled since the rulings often reveal where the secret ink pen has 
passed over them. 

The duller the surface the better; newsprint, being poorly sized is 
best of all, and letters or words can be picked out with dots of 
invisible ink. Censors know this, of course and are vigilant in 
cases where bundles of newspapers are regularly sent to a given 
address, unless direct from the papers' offices. Then, of course 
there is the old trick of writing (or dotting on newspaper) an 
apparently secret but less important message in an ink fairly easily 
(but not too easily) detected, and the real message in a really safe 
ink. Many censors have fallen for this, but the times when it can be 
used are limited, as the message is usually sent on with 
instructions to watch the person collecting it. If the first message 
is well done, to appear to be about innocent but private (e.g. 
family) affairs, such a message may be allowed into neutral 
territory or ignored. 

An agent should always experiment with his proposed ink and paper 
and satisfy himself as to the best ink strength, and conditions of 
steaming, or damping and ironing. 

As in the case of codes and cyphers whenever a simple ink is used a 
sample should be developed to ensure that the correct strength is 
being used. 

A secret ink should always be used at the maximum dilution capable 
of being detected by the best developer, and this dilution 
ascertained before hand. It is useful to memorize 
that - 

A 1% solution is made by dissolving - 1 gramme (gm) in 100 cubic 
centimeters (ccs) or Millimetres (ml). 

The British apothecaries amounts equal to the above are 15 grains 
(gr) and 3*^2 fluid ounces (fl.oz). Other dilutions can be calculated 
from this. 

Spoons and cups are not reliable units of volume, but a medicine 
bottle is usually marked with its volume in fluid ounces. 

A grade of paper technically called "onion skin" which is thin and 
strong with marked "rattle" is often favourable for secret ink work 


240 SOE SYLLABUS 


since it has a natural wrinkle or cockle like that produced by 
secret inks. Censors know this also however, and since such papers 
are not normally used for writing (except sometimes for air mail), 
they are perhaps best avoided. The writer has seen a letter to a 
German prisoner of war tested for no other apparent reason than the 
use of this paper. 

Ball pointed nibs were formally used but their possession is enough 
to hang a man in war time. A turned up nib such as the universally 
known "Waverley" is as good. The pen should be held level, at the 
smallest angle to the paper possible and used with a light touch, so 
long as liquid is actually being deposited. 

A clean nib should always be used, preferably a brass one. 

Secret inks have this advantage over cyphers and codes, except the 
well known "innocent letter" code, that cyphers and codes are 
suspect at once and can always be broken if enough time and material 
is available. The "innocent letter" if well done, is probably the 
best means of all, but it requires a definite standard of 
intelligence and education. If these are lacking, or there was no 
possibility of compiling a code, secret inks, well managed, are the 
next best. In any case secret writing is really only a variation of 
the "innocent letter", since it is never sent on a bare sheet, but 
always accompanied by an innocent letter, typed or written.

MINOR TACTICS 


Para-Military training is the basis of the type of warfare known as 
diversive or guerrilla warfare. Operations of this nature are 
usually carried out by bands of patriots in countries over-run by 
the enemy, and behind the lines. In the initial stages such bands 
may be unco-ordinated, and developed on the initiative of local 
patriot leaders. Later, they may be brought into closer touch, and 
may work in full co-operation with the field armies (cf. Russia). 

While these operations are of necessity limited in extent, owing to 
the difference in size of the opposing forces, a small well trained 
and well led band of partisans can do damage to the enemy which is 
out of all proportion to the size of the band. 

Three important features of this type of warfare are: 

1. Speed and aggression in the attack, followed by quick get-away. 
SURPRISE IS ESSENTIAL. 

2. The ability to strike at many points, either at the same time or 
at different times, in order to harass the enemy and keep him 
always on the alert. 

3. All attacks must be directed against targets which, if destroyed, 
will bring about the maximum amount of damage to the enemy war 
effort - 

a) Directly and immediately, such as attacks on enemy 
headquarters during a battle. 

b) Indirectly; attacks on communications, supplies, or industrial 
production. 

The results of such diversive attacks on the enemy can be far 
reaching: 

1. Attacks on supplies, transport, or industries can slow down and 
partially disorganize the whole war effort. 

2. Such attacks force the enemy to disperse his troops for police 
and garrison duties. 

3. This lowers their morale and consequently their efficiency. 

While the importance of this type of warfare is great, it is as well 
to consider its limitations. 

1. It is not often possible, for reasons of security, for large 
bands to operate. This of necessity limits the scope of 
operations, and makes the selection of the right target vitally 
important. 



SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 249 


2. Because the Germans fear this type of attack they take stern 
measures to stamp it out. 

3. It is difficult to secure weapons, supplies and explosives. 

4. It is difficult, and often impossible, to co-ordinate guerrilla 
operations into a concerted plan over a wide area. 

In view of the factors outlined above, it is essential in guerrilla 
warfare operations that each soldier adheres to the following basic 
principles: 

1. He must have complete knowledge of the country in which he is 
operating, or failing this, expert knowledge of how to make the 
best use of, and move about in, strange country. 

2. He must have expert knowledge of all weapons used by his 
guerrilla band, and also if possible, full knowledge of as many 
weapons as possible used by the enemy. 

3. He must give at all times complete obedience to his leader, and 
be absolutely devoted to the cause. 

The nature of guerrilla warfare demands particular attention to: 

1. FIELDCRAFT . 

Since the element of surprise is essential in all particular 
operations, fieldcraft requires the greatest attention. In Depot 
School training students receive instruction in individual 
Fieldcraft. The Para-Military instruction carries this training 
further, and students are required to apply their knowledge to 
the infinitely more difficult job of collective fieldcraft. It is 
very much more difficult to conceal ten men than one, and very 
much harder for ten men to move about silently at night together. 

The only way this can be achieved is for every man to concentrate 
the whole time on his own individual fieldcraft, and remember 
that if he makes a mistake it endangers the lives of all his 
companions. 

FPfm ati Q hs. 

Any party of men moving across country should move in a definite 
formation, not in a constantly changing huddle or a straggling 
line. The reasons for this, and the essentials of any formation, 
are to ensure: 

a) Maximum use of available cover. 

b) Permanent all-round defence. 

c) Adequate communication between all members of the party, but 
particularly between the leader and his scouts. 

A great many formations have been devised for use by the regular 




250 SOE SYLLABUS 


army, some of which fulfil these requirements, but most are 
unsatisfactory because they are impossible to maintain either for 
a long distance or in broken country, and very few really ensure 
the maximum use of available cover. Chiefly for this latter 
reason S.T.S. do not use the diamond and box shaped formations. 

For a small body of men moving across any type of country, either 
by night or by day, there are no better formations than modified 
versions of single file. Scouts, according to conditions and 
circumstances, must always be ahead of this file. The main body, 
headed by the leader, follows on in single file. 

The intervals between the members of the party, and between the 
scouts and the leader, depend entirely on the nature of the 
ground and the limit of visibility. The scouts must be in touch 
with the leader and in touch with each other; once they are out 
of sight of the leader they are useless. Under the best 
visibility conditions it is not desirable for scouts to be more 
than 100 - 150 metres in front of the leader; in darkness or in 
very close country 20 metres would be enough. The leader must 
watch his scouts the whole time for any signal they may give him 
- they are his eyes. 

The only time when a considerable interval between members of the 
main party is desirable is when, for instance, an open hillside 
must be crossed in distant view of the enemy. Here a close mass 
of men moving would be visible when widely separated men would 
not. Each man of the party is detailed to observe in a particular 
direction the whole time, and he must be able to draw the 
leader's attention to anything that he sees with the least 
possible delay - a wide interval between members of the party 
makes this difficult. 

When the party halts, it is automatically covered by the scouts, 
to ensure that it is not taken by surprise. This should be an 
invariable rule, whatever the reason for the halt. 

Also, whatever the reason for the halt, the whole of the main 
party must immediately get into cover. The practice of halting 
for discussion in exposed places is very common in training, and 
is a very serious fault. As soon as the leader realises that a 
halt is necessary, whether because he is off his route and must 
use the map, or because he has reached the end of a bound and 
must wait for the scouts to observe, he must immediately get his 
party into a position where they cannot be seen. This is all the 
more important if the halt is in order to study the map - the 
white flash of a map can be seen at a great distance, and at no 
time should more of it be exposed than is absolutely necessary. 

2. MAP DIRECTION FINDING . 

Very often the partisan force will be so familiar with the 
country that the use of maps and compasses will not be necessary. 
But the time may come when the band is forced to operate in 
unfamiliar territory. Therefore, the partisan fighter must be 



SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 251 


adept in the handling of maps and compasses, and he must bear in 
mind that unless he makes his observation (while reading the map 
or compass) from behind cover, he runs a serious risk of giving 
himself away. Fieldcraft will therefore play an important part in 
direction finding. 

3. WEAPONS . 

Pistols. Sub-Machine Guns, Grenades . 

The partisan fighter must have complete confidence in the weapon 
with which he is armed. He must regard it as a weapon which, if 
necessary he can use to force his way to the target to accomplish 
his task, or to destroy any enemy who attempts to prevent his 
withdrawal. 

Should his weapon become useless, he must be ready and able to 
use his hands, or any other weapon which may be available. 

He must learn to take care of his weapons, and to check up before 
he starts to ensure that his weapon is working, and that he has 
sufficient ammunition. This ammunition must be carried so that it 
is readily available. 

4. EXPLOSIVES- 

If explosives are carried, the maxim "The Demolition must not 
fail" will be borne in mind the whole time. Therefore: 

a) All the charges and other stores must be prepared very 
carefully and completely before setting out. 

b) Full allowance must be made for the possibility of casualties, 
i.e., a compete duplicate set of demolition stores should be 
carried, and every single man in the party should be equipped 
to do some damage on his own if plans miscarry. 

While at the Para-Military School students will carry out a 
number of day and night schemes, and will have practice in 
planning small operations of the type mentioned above. 

It will not be possible to achieve complete realism in targets 
and the military background, such as would be the case in the 
field. Every attempt will be made, however, to make schemes 
realistic. 

Students will only get the maximum benefit from schemes if they 
use their imagination, and carry out the scheme as if it were a 
real operation. They must never do anything in a scheme which 
they would not do in the field.

TACTICS OF SMALL RAIDING PARTIES 


1. INTRODUCTION . 

This lecture is designed to cover the tactical action of a small 
body of men attacking a guarded objective with explosives or 
incendiaries. It is not intended to cover the action of an 
individual or a very small party carrying out an operation by 
stealth alone. 

The target for such a raid might be any worth-while objective 
which may be destroyed by demolition or by fire. Raiding parties 
may, of course, attack objectives which it is more convenient to 
destroy by some other means. In general, the tactics of the raid 
will remain the same, though the composition of the party and 
individual action will naturally differ. 

2. TH E COMPOS IT I O N Q E-TH E PA RTY* 

The remarks which follow have in view a basic party of 10 men, 
but are applicable to much greater numbers. 

In an attack such as we have visualised above, the factors to be 
overcome to achieve success will be essentially: 

a) the enemy guarding the objective, and 

b) the objective itself. 

In addition, the party must reach the objective in safety, must 
be undisturbed while the work is done, and must withdraw in 
safety. The composition of the party follows logically upon these 
points. 

Leader : First, as in any operation, there must be a leader , who 
controls the entire operation. Among other things, it is his job 
to see that the men chosen for the various jobs outlined below 
are suitable for their work. 

Sentry Party : Second, there must be a small force whose job is to 
deal with the enemy at the objective. This we call the sentry 
party, since the sentries are the only people who will in all 
cases have to be dealt with in some way. Although in a great many 
cases the plan will be to avoid the enemy altogether, the sentry 
party must be prepared to kill them in case of emergency. The 
sentry party prepare the way for the 

Demolition, or Assault. Party , whose job it is to effect the 
actual destruction of the target. They must be undisturbed while 
at work, and this is looked after by the 

Covering Party . Their job is to see that while both the sentry 











SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 253 


party and the demolition party are, in turn, at work, they are 
not surprised by unexpected enemy - or in some cases to engage 
and delay an expected enemy. 

These are the essential components of the party, and will vary in 
strength according to the strength of the objective and the 
number of men available. An estimate of exactly how many men are 
required for any piece of work must always be formed by the 
leader. 

The exact action of these various components we shall now discuss 
in detail. 

3. ACTION AT THE STARTING POINT . 

a) While the main body is assembling, the Covering Party will be 
responsible for all-round defence. 

b) The leader and sub-leaders (if any) will make a careful check 
of all demolition stores, weapons and equipment, and their 
proper distribution amongst the various members of the party. 

c) The leader will make a final check that no man is carrying any 
incriminating papers or documents, or any loose articles 
liable to make a noise, e.g. coins, keys, half-full match 
boxes, half-full water bottles, etc. 

d) Each man's personal camouflage, if this is being used, will be 
checked. 

e) Watches should be synchronised. 

f) Last but not least, check that each man knows his orders. 

4. MO VE MENT T OWA RDS THE O BJEC TIVE - 

The formation recommended (already referred to in previous 
lectures) is that of single file, with scouts ahead. The number 
of scouts used will vary with the number of men available. Three 
is the maximum. Behind them, at a distance varying with the 
visibility and possibilities of communication with the leader, 
come the main party, whose movement they are safeguarding. The 
scout's job is to make certain that any enemy, or difficult 
features of the ground, are made known to the leader before he 
stumbles upon them unaware, and to ensure that the party follows 
the best available route. The scouts are drawn from the covering 
party. 

The main party will usually be disposed as follows: 

In front is the leader, in communication with his scouts; behind 
him come part of the remainder of the covering party, so that the 
comparatively defenceless demolition party are sandwiched between 
the two sections of the covering party. 




254 SOE SYLLABUS 


The demolition party will be carrying stores which are sometimes 
heavy; they will also require their hands to be free at the 
objective, so that they cannot be encumbered with bulky weapons. 
They must be treated largely as passengers during the advance, 
though they will retain responsibility for observing in a certain 
direction, as already outlined in the lecture 'General Movement 
by Day'. 

Whether the sentry party is also sandwiched between two sections 
of the covering party, will depend on how the leader has armed 
them. If they are to kill silently, they must also be 
unencumbered with bulky weapons, and the same considerations will 
apply to them as apply to the demolition party. If they are to 
kill the sentries by fire, they will be adequately armed and may 
bring up the rear of the party - though in all cases the rearmost 
man should also be the second in command of the party. 

The party moves forward by bounds - this was also discussed in an 
earlier lecture - and at any time when the party is stationary, 
the covering party should take up position to protect it as it 
would at the objective. 

5. THE__RECON NAISSANCE POINT . 

The leader, either from personal reconnaissance or from 
information received, will have previously selected a point from 
which to make his final reconnaissance. This we term the "recce 
point". At a convenient place some distance short of the recce 
point the leader will leave his party under cover and protected 
by the covering party, and will himself go forward alone to make 
his final reconnaissance. In cases where this final 
reconnaissance cannot well be done by one man only, he may send a 
second or third member of the party to deal with those areas 
which he cannot himself reconnoitre. 

The object of this final reconnaissance is to ensure that no 
change in the situation has occurred which might upset the 
leader's plans. When it is finished he will return to his party 
and either issue necessary amendments to his orders or tell them 
that his original orders stand. 

6. DISPOSITIO NS- #! THE OBJE CTIVE■ 

The leader's next action is to place the various components of 
his party in position for the attack. First, the covering party 
will be placed. Their positions must afford the maximum field of 
view and of fire and should also afford cover to the sentry party 
themselves should they need assistance - thus making certain that 
the sentries can in no case interfere. Where the ground makes 
this double function of the covering party impossible, there must 
be one section of the covering party, whose function at the 
objective is solely to cover the sentry party, and then revert to 
a normal covering function. Communication signals between the 
covering party and the leader will have been previously arranged 
- also the exact action to be taken by them in the case of enemy 




SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 255 


approach or other circumstances visualised by the leader. 

Next, the leader will despatch both the sentry party and the 
demolition party simultaneously. The sentry party will be sent to 
previously determined positions from which to deal with the 
sentries. The considerations which affect the method by which they 
will do this are discussed in detail in the next lecture. Even when 
the plan is to avoid the sentries altogether, the sentry party 
should be in position to deal with them in case of emergency. 

The leader will aim at getting the demolition party as close as 
possible to the objective, ready for immediate action when the 
signal for assault is given. If this is not done there will be a 
delay between the signal and the laying of the charges, which may 
just give time to the enemy to locate and cut off the party’s 
withdrawal. 

If there is no specific reason against it, the leader himself 
will usually be with the demolition party, where he can control 
the actual destruction of the objective, without which the 
operation has failed. 

7. AC TION AT THE O BJE CTIVE . 

We assume that the various sections of the party are now in their 
final position and waiting for the attack to start. This action 
starts immediately the sentry party have killed the sentries, or, 
if they are to be avoided, when the leader gives the word that 
the coast is clear. 

In a case where the sentry or sentries are killed by fire, the 
sound of that shot is the signal for the assault to go in. 

Whether the shot was fired by the sentry party or the sentry will 
not matter, for if it was fired by the latter, the covering party 
(see above) will kill him immediately. 

Simultaneous action now takes place. The demolition party, under 
the immediate control of the leader, move quickly in and place 
their charges. The sentry party, whose job is now finished, take 
up position as an inner perimeter covering party. If a 
simultaneous attack upon the guardroom which supplies the 
sentries is part of the plan, this attack also goes in upon the 
same signal. The actual drill for such an attack is described in 
the next lecture. 

As soon as the placing of the charges is completed, the leader 
will give his signal for the withdrawal. If the killing of the 
sentries has been done by fire, this signal may be an overt one, 
such as blasts upon a whistle. If, on the other hand, the killing 
has been done silently, or the sentries have been avoided, there 
will so far have been no noise and a delayed action charge will 
have been used, so that the party is well off the scene of action 
when the explosion takes place. In this case the signal for 
withdrawal must therefore be such as to arouse no suspicion; as 
will also have been all previous signals. 



256 SOE SYLLABUS 


8. WITHDRAWAL . 

As soon as the signal for withdrawal is given, the party will 
withdraw in the following order: 

First, the demolition party, who, being lightly armed, must at 
all costs avoid contact with the enemy, and with them the sentry 
party who have formed an inner perimeter covering party and will 
now act as scouts to the withdrawing demolition party. Last to 
withdraw will be the covering party proper, who have heavier 
weapons and can bring more fire to bear in case of necessity. 

They will follow the demolition party as soon as they are certain 
that the latter are off the ground. They will keep a constant 
watch to the rear, but must on no account open fire upon any 
relieving enemy unless certain that they are detected. 

The whole party meet at a rendezvous at a safe distance from the 
objective. Here the leader checks his party, makes certain that 
they are all present, reforms them into the order of march as for 
approach, or orders a dispersed withdrawal from that point. 

A dispersed withdrawal by night is extremely difficult if the 
various members of the party are heading for the same place, 
because their routes are liable to approximate, and in the dark 
it is difficult to tell friend from foe. Thus, the party may 
individually be pinned to the ground, each man thinking the 
other's to be enemy searching for him. 

The leader will have ordered a time limit for arrival at this 
rendezvous after which any member of the party not present will 
be considered a casualty. 

9. CQMMWICATIQNS - 

The whole question of signals is considered to be of such 
importance that it is dealt with in a separate lecture. 

10. DEALING WITH CASUALTIES . 

Casualties present a far greater problem to the raiding party 
than to the ordinary soldier. Since it is absolutely essential 
that the raiding party should be off the scene of action as soon 
as their job is done, the most satisfactory method is probably to 
arrange a subsequent rendezvous not far away, to which wounded 
will make their way if capable of doing so. The leader should 
state in his orders the location of this emergency rendezvous and 
at what time (preferably during darkness on two successive 
nights) it will be visited by the search party. Where it has been 
possible to arrange this, medical stores may be left in advance 
at this R.V., and the search party should be equipped for 
carrying a wounded man or men. In the majority of cases it is 
improbable that the leader will be able to make any arrangement 
for any who are too seriously wounded to reach this rendezvous. 





SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 257 


11. TIMING . 

An operation must be most carefully timed if it is to succeed. 

a) If more than one party is operating, the attack and any 
demolitions must be simultaneous. Ample time must be allowed 
for all parties to reach their objective. 

b) Ample time, greater than the amount estimated, must be allowed 
for the approach, and especially for the sentry party to get 
into final position. 

c) A margin must be allowed at the objective for unexpected 
incidents (i.e. for the changing of the guard if the time of 
this is not previously known). 

d) Meteorological data must also be studied. 


12. WEAPONS . 


Although the details of the plan usually decide what arms are to 
be carried by the sub-sections of the party, certain general 
principles apply to all raiding parties of this type. 

Every man in the party should be armed with a knife, and it is 
usually possible for every man also to carry a pistol as a 
reserve weapon against emergency. If a pistol is to be carried at 
all, it is worth while to carry not less than 3 magazines. 

The Leader , although in a demolitions raid he will be operating 
with the demolition party at the target area, will probably not 
handle the charges himself. He can therefore carry a sub-machine 
gun, which will be the only automatic weapon with the demolition 
party. 

The Sentry Party will be armed according to the method by which 
it is intended to deal with the sentries, and their subsequent 
covering party function must be looked upon as secondary. For 
example, if the sentry is to be killed silently, it is useless to 
encumber the party with a sub-machine gun; if he is to be killed 
noisily, the possible nearness of approach to the sentry will 
decide whether the weapon should be a rifle or a sub-machine gun. 
(The ranges at which these weapons should be relied upon for this 
purpose are discussed in the next lecture.) The leader must also 
decide whether in the circumstances it would be advisable for his 
sentry party to carry grenades. 

The Demolition Party must confine themselves to small, light 
weapons, since 

a) they may already be carrying heavy stores, and 

b) they will require their hands to be free at the target area. 


Knives, pistols, grenades. 







258 SOE SYLLABUS 


The Covering Party . In theory, the heavier the weapons employed 
by the covering party, the better. It is, however, often 
impracticable for a light machine gun, say, to be carried 
successfully over a long and stealthy approach. Where the leader 
decides that this is possible, the L.M.G. is the ideal weapon in 
that it has both range and volume of fire, and can deploy and pin 
down interfering enemy as no lighter weapon can. In default of an 
L.M.G., sub-machine guns, at least one rifle to do any accurate 
shooting that may be required, and grenades, form the covering 
party's weapons. 

All the above are general considerations and must be modified 
according to the particular operation in question. Grenades are 
best carried in belt pouches, with the grenades across the back, 
where they do not cause discomfort when crawling. Men carrying 
sub-machine guns should carry as large a number of magazines as 
is possible in view of their other commitments. It should be 
remembered that magazines are noisy things to carry unless some 
arrangement is made to guard against it. 

13. P . E M9L I 1LQN..CHARGES AND STORES • 

The Demolition Party will naturally be responsible for the main 
demolition charges and means of initiation, although if the total 
weight of explosive is large and the distance to be covered 
considerable, it may be necessary to distribute the stores over 
the whole party during the approach. To ensure success for the 
operation, however, the following stores should always be 
carried: 

a) 1 complete duplicate set of charges carried by the covering 
party; 

b) A spare means of firing the charge(s) to be carried by every 
member of the party. 

In an attack on any industrial target where opportunities for 
doing damage to machinery and installations other than the main 
target are likely to present themselves, it would be a good idea 
to equip the non-demolition members with extra small charges, say 
1 lb. each.

DEALING WITH ENEMY PERSONNEL AT THE OBJECTIVE 

In almost every scheme or operation one of the deciding factors is 
the nature of the defences on the objective. Of these defences the 
personnel play the most important part, since no wire or other 
obstacle is insurmountable if undefended. 

In an operation involving demolition of the objective, the immediate 
personnel to be dealt with will be sentries. They can be dealt with 
as follows: 

1. They can be avoided altogether, and a short delayed action 
used for the demolition. 

2. They can be killed silently, so that the guard and other 
supporting troops are not aroused. In most cases a short 
delayed action would be used here too. 

3. They can be shot or dealt with by grenades. In this case a 
delayed action could not be used, because there would be every 
chance of its being discovered and removed. 

What governs the choice of general method from the above three? The 
main considerations are these: 

Methods (1) and (2) are used when the noisy killing would result in 
a fight with a force too strong for the attackers. They are usually 
impossible to employ by day. 

Method (1 ) would be used only where the sentry's beat or position 
does not efficiently guard the objective, so that to kill him is 
merely an extra danger and difficulty to the operation. 

Method ( 2 ) would be used where noisy killing would bring a strong 
enemy force on to the scene of action too quickly for the operation 
to be completed. (Remember that the operation includes the 
withdrawal.) 

Method (3) would be used when either (a) the guard-room is a long 
way off and therefore could not interfere or (b) the guard is small 
enough to engage and destroy, and the support troops could not 
arrive in time to interfere. In this method the shot or shots 
killing the sentry should be the signal both for the attack on the 
guardroom and the placing of the charges. The guardroom (if it is to 
be attacked) is dealt with as follows: Two men take up position as 
near as possible to the windows and wait for the signal of the shot. 
Immediately they hear it they throw their grenades through the 
windows, keep down while the grenades burst, then dash into the room 
with sub-machine guns. While waiting for the signal, grenade safety 
pins should be eased but not withdrawn. In daylight the man (or men) 
detailed to shoot sentries should try to get within 50 yards with a 










260 SOE SYLLABUS 


rifle or even closer with an S.M.G. for certainty. While a trained 
sniper may feel certain of success at much greater ranges, remember 
that the whole operation may depend on the killing of the sentry 
with the first shot. At night, according to the light available, 
S.M.G. or pistol - never a rifle - can be used at very close range, 
i.e. a few yards only and sufficiently close to be able to see the 
effect of your shot and to complete the killing at point blank range 
if necessary. 

Remember that the enemy's communications decide how quickly he can 
get help from the supporting troops. Therefore, if you can, destroy 
communications at the last moment . If you destroy them too soon, 
before you are ready to attack, the destruction may be discovered 
and a party sent to investigate. 

General Considerations. 

Guards are changed at intervals - in cold weather more often than in 
warm weather. In Norway, guards are often changed every half-hour. 
This factor must be taken into account and mentioned in the orders; 
if it is not known it must be found out by observation. 

The N.C.O. i/c guard will visit the guard during his tour of duty at 
least once; this must also be taken into account because a dead 
guard is just as dangerous if he is discovered while the party is on 
the job, as a live one. There is also the orderly officer who may 
come round on a tour of inspection at any time. 

The party will have to approach near enough to the objective to 
observe the sentry, when they have studied the routine they will 
then select their opportunity. 

Supposing that the guard has a tour of duty of 2 hours and is 
visited once during that tour by the N.C.O. When he comes on duty he 
will be sleepy and partly blinded by the light of the guardroom - 
this will wear off after about 1/2-hour. However, he will gradually 
be roused by the cold and at the back of his mind there is always 
the thought of the N.C.O.'s visit. 

The N.C.O. perhaps visits him at the end of the first hour. This 
will make him temporarily more alert but afterwards he can relax 
again and then he thinks only of the end of his tour of duty, now 
drawing slowly but steadily nearer. This is the time when a sentry 
is most off his guard - and although no hard and fast rule can be 
laid down, on a tour of duty of two hours, experience has shown that 
the period between 1 hour and l - l "2 hours after he mounts is the 
worst time of a tour of duty. At this time the minutes seem to drag 
intolerably and the difficulty of keeping awake is most serious. The 
German Army is making use of Sentry Companies to guard lines of 
communication, etc. in occupied countries. These consist of older 
troops and young troops and are not to be described as first class. 
But of course this is by no means the rule. 

The party must therefore decide to make its attack: 






SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 261 


a) Either when the sentry is still seeing badly after being mounted 
and is still sleepy, or 

b) After the N.C.O. has visited him and he is relaxing again and 
counting the time till he is relieved. 

A sentry must be most carefully observed before he is attacked . An 

opportunity will always present itself and must be seized upon at 
once. The sentry may lean his rifle against something to rub his 
hands or to have a run off. Or if he doesn't do that he will sling 
it over his shoulder. No sentry is alert all the time, especially 
when he has been on the same job for some time. 

When the sentry has been noiselessly despatched, one man at least 
must watch the guardroom afterwards in case the N.C.O. comes out 
again or the orderly officer turns up.

APPENDIX. 

NOTE ON GERMAN SENTRIES . 

FRANCE . 


1. Camps and large store dumps are guarded mainly by Sentry Coys., 
usually of older troops and not first line troops. 

2. Important objectives are protected by wire and wooden searchlight 
towers, containing a searchlight and M.G. (French pattern) at the 
four corners. (See fig.) 



3. The sentries walk towards each other and patrol the perimeter so 
that if they are out of sight of each other it is only for a very 
short time. They meet under the towers. 

4. The guard-room may be some way away but it is connected by 'phone 
to the towers and to the nearest H.Q. troops. 

5. The guard commander relieves each sentry separately, marching him 
back to the guard-room and returning with his relief. 

6. If the alarm is given the search-lights go on and the guard 
automatically turns out. 

7. The sentries do not always stick to the perimeter but may patrol 
some way from it if they thus obtain a better view. 

8. Bridges are usually guarded by outlying posts in the fields or 
gardens with M.G.'s. 



Road blocks are built near the bridges connected by telephone to 
the next one along the road. 


If the bridge is a big one there is usually a sentry under or on 
the bridge as well. 
















SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 263 


9. Aerodromes are guarded by standing patrols at various points and 
there are rarely sentries on individual aircraft. 

10. Headquarters in towns are inside a good house, with patrols 
going round at intervals.

AMBUSHES 

1. DEFINITION ■ 

A trap to catch and destroy a moving objective; more usually a 
vehicle or vehicles. 

2. SUITABLE OBJECTIVES. 


a) Su pplies . 

Food, amnunition, fuel, essential spare parts such as tires, etc. 

The destruction of the stores carried by the vehicles will 
usually be of much greater importance than the destruction of 
the vehicles themselves, since, in war, the loss of a few 
vehicles is negligible. 

The importance of the above supplies will always be qualified 
by the following considerations: 

i) Whether the intended recipients are relying upon these 
stores to continue their particular effort. 

ii) Whether the stores will be of use to the partisans 

themselves. Thus, for example, it is possible that the 
destruction of tires, petrol, or spare parts may render a 
number of vehicles immobile; or the destruction of 
ammunition or food might render a besieged enemy incapable 
of continuing their resistance. 

b) Personnel ■ 

The ambushing of troops on the march is rarely possible to the 
partisan, nor, unless their destruction served an immediate 
end, could they be considered a worth-while objective. Should 
these troops, however, be those specifically employed against 
partisan activity, their destruction might be said to serve an 
immediate purpose, or, if they were reserve troops moving up 
for a particular action, their destruction, or even delay, 
might be of great importance. 

In general, however, the following personnel may be said to be 
the most worth-while objectives: 

Luftwaffe personnel; 

High grade staff officers; 

Despatch riders, who may be carrying papers of 
importance. 

The effect of ambushing the latter may be considerable. The 
moral effect of the complete disappearance of despatch riders 









SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 265 


will be great; large guards will have to be provided, thereby 
leading to further dispersal of enemy forces; documents will 
be lost that may cause delay or disruption of enemy action. 

c) Summary . 

Attacks should be carried out against supplies rather than 
against personnel, unless the latter are of great importance. 
The destruction of the German soldier is the job of the Army 
proper, and for the partisan to engage enemy troops is usually 
too risky a procedure. 

3. SCOPE . 

Scope is strictly limited by enemy tactics in the particular 
district where the partisan may be working, and the composition 
and organization of enemy convoys. Particularly does this apply to 
the interval between vehicles both in daylight and in darkness. It 
can be taken as axiomatic that in districts where Allied air 
attack is to be feared, convoys will - if they proceed in daylight 
at all - move with wide intervals between the vehicles. This 
interval may be as much as 300 metres. In such cases it is clearly 
extremely difficult for a small party to attack a convoy of even 
four vehicles, except by treating each vehicle as a separate 
ambush. The possibilities of 'cutting out' the last vehicle in the 
line will in such a case be worth considering. 

As in all partisan operations, the leader must form an accurate 
estimate of the number of men required for the work, and an 
objective requiring a larger force of men must immediately be 
ruled out as far as he is concerned. 

Under this heading we must consider the probable composition of 
Axis convoys. It is difficult to lay down many general rules 
owing to the difference in the amount of interference which the 
enemy expects in different districts. Some points, however, will 
remain constant. 

a) Even in the case of a single vehicle which is an important 
objective, there will always be an outrider. In districts 
where no partisan interference is expected this will often be 
a motor-cycle at some distance ahead of the vehicle, varying 
with the type of country through which he is progressing. In 
the case of a heavy convoy in a district where attack is to be 
expected, the outrider may be an armoured car; or even, in 
guerrilla-ridden countries like Russia, a tank. The job of 
this outrider is to try to locate trouble before the convoy 
reaches it. 

b) in the case of even the smallest convoy carrying important 
supplies, there will be guard troops on one or more of the 
vehicles. 

c) The whole convoy will have certain definite orders as to 
action in case of attack. 






266 SOE SYLLABUS 


4. NECESSARY INFORMATION FOR AN AMBUSH . 

This should try to establish the details of the general rules 
outlined above. 

a) A time and place at which the convoy may be expected and its 
route; 

b) The speed, and interval between vehicles; 

c) The numbers and composition of the convoy; 

d) The type of vehicle used as an outrider or other covering force; 

e) Guards - the fire power which they can bring to bear 
immediately; 

f) The enemy's orders in case of attack. 

All except (f) above may probably be found out by observation 
several days before the attack is made, although the time and 
composition of a convoy can never be relied on. 

5. TACTICS OF THE ATTACK . 

Boiled down to its essentials, the ambush requires: 

a) Something to stop the objective; 

b) A suitable place in which to stop it; 

c) The choice of the best time to attack; 

d) Man to effect its destruction. 

These four headings will be considered separately: 

a) Something to stop the objective: 

This heading may be roughly divided into means that require 
the use of explosives and those that do not. 

Under the first heading are the following, though it must be 
realized that an almost infinite variety of methods are 
possible, dependent upon the type of country, the ingenuity of 
the individual: 

i) Mining the road at a culvert or small bridge, 

ii) Mining the road by excavation (only possible in country 
roads without a macadam surface.) 

iii) Pulling a charge across the road at the last moment and 
firing it as the leading vehicle of the main convoy 
passes over it. 

iv) Blowing some obstacle into place on the road, such as 
trees or rocks. 

In all these cases the charge is fired electrically at the 
critical moment. 





SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 267 


Normal concealed anti-tank mines, or other home-made mines, 
which the vehicle itself initiates. 

Under the second heading - those which do not require 
explosives - the following may be mentioned. Again, an 
infinite variety is possible according to the circumstances. 

i) A tree may be partly sawn through and pulled down with 
rope at the critical moment. 

ii) Some vehicle, such as a farm cart, may be pulled, or 
pushed, or released across the road from a concealed 
position or a side alley. 

There are also various methods, which, although not genuine 
obstacles to progress, will have the effect of stopping the 
convoy. It must be remembered, however, that should the action 
not go according to plan, the leading vehicle of the convoy 
may realise that the door of the trap is not genuinely closed 
and may make an exit and getaway. 

i) Artificial headlights used at night, 
ii) A mirror used in the same circumstances. Nothing less 
than a mirror of wardrobe size would be of any use. 

iii) Live stock driven across the road, or, in larger 
quantities, driven down the road, 

iv) A blanket on a string or rope, hung across the road to 
obscure the vehicle. 

v) Dannert wire drawn across the road at the last moment, 

vi) Dummy anti-tank mines, such as plates inverted, 

vii) Some large and recognisable object of value lying in the 
road. 

Since, as we shall see when considering the tactics proper, 
the outrider must always be allowed to pass through the trap, 
it is obviously much more difficult to place these objects in 
position at the correct moment. 

b) A suitable place in which to stop the objective; 

The first considerations under this heading must be those 
which facilitate the stopping of the convoy, and the second 
will be those that facilitate its destruction. 

The considerations which affect the choice of site from the 
point of view of stopping the convoy will be these: 

i) Either a bend or a rise in the road, so that the road-block 
(and possibly the attacking force itself) will not be seen by 
the leading vehicle of the convoy until it is right on top of 
it. Thus, the obstacle can be placed immediately the outrider 
has passed, instead of at the moment when the leading vehicle 
of the convoy proper reaches the desired spot, 
ii) A road from which it is not possible for the vehicles to 
make a cross-country detour past the obstruction - i.e. a 
sunken road, a road out high into the side of a hill, or 



268 SOE SYLLABUS 


one bounded by water upon one side and, say, a rock face 
upon the other. (N.B. If the convoy is going fast at the 
time when the first vehicle encounters the obstacle, 
there will be a greater likelihood of the rear vehicles 
piling up upon the front ones and thus helping the 
attackers. It is, however, easier both to stop and to 
estimate the positions of vehicles when they are going 
very slowly - i.e. up a very steep hill, or round a 
hairpin bend). 

To facilitate the destruction of the objective: 

i) Concealment for the attacking force, both from view and 
from fire. 

ii) A line of approach to these positions from the rear. The 
positions should never be occupied from the front because 
cover may be obviously displaced, 

iii) A line of withdrawal covered and leading to some safe 
place. 

iv) There must be no cover for the enemy guards if they leave 
the vehicles - i.e. steep unclimbable sides of a ravine, 
or an open space which can be swept by fire. 

Summary : Ideal place may be said to be a sharp bend in a road 
which has upon the one side a wide open space and upon the 
other steep rising ground with sufficient cover to hide the 
attackers. A very great advantage is secured by being above 
the convoy, in that ditches, etc. no longer represent cover to 
the enemy; it is more difficult for the enemy to direct 
accurate fire steeply upwards; it is easier for the attackers 
to throw hand missiles; a wider field of fire and of view is 
usually obtained; and it is difficult for the enemy to "come 
to grips". Whether it is best for the attackers to be all upon 
the one side of the road or upon both, will depend upon: 

i) Possible safety from each other's fire; 

ii) Possible lines of withdrawal in the event of the action 
having to be broken off. 

c) The choice of the best time to attack: 

A good many of the 'variables' of an ambush are affected by 
the time of day or night chosen. The main points affected are 
these: 

i) The speed of and interval between vehicles . At night they 
will generally move slowly and closed up. By day they 
will move strung out at various intervals and as fast as 
roads permit. 

ii) The concealment of the attackers and their trap - this is 
plainly much easier by night. 

iii) The action itself - this requires a certain minimum of 
light for the best use of all weapons against the 
objective. This could of course be produced by flares at 
night, but the attack is likely to be less confused if 







SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 269 


carried out by dawn or evening light. 

iv) The withdrawal of the attackers - it may be of importance 
for the attackers to have a good period of darkness to 
cover their withdrawal. In this case a late evening 
attack would be indicated. 

v) Enemy resistance and morale. The enemy's morale is likely 
to be at its lowest in early dawn after driving through 
the night. 

d) Men to effect the destruction of the objective - the 

dlsposj,tign_ of__thg_ party : 

i) Look-outs must be posted at strategic points to give 

warning of the approach of the convoy or of other traffic 
from either direction. With the additional function of 
signalling the approach of the objective, their role is 
identical to that of the normal covering party. They must 
be able to contact the leader by visual signal or by 
chain of signals. 

ii) Forward Party , will be forward of the road block party 
and will deal with the outrider, who has first been 
allowed to pass through the trap. This party will be 
at the point which it is estimated the outrider will 
have reached at the moment the convoy is halted. When 
its work is complete, the forward party will take 
position as an extra covering party in the forward 
direction. 

iii) Road Block Party , whose job is to place the road block 
(of whatever type) in position. The leader will be with 
this party and he will give the order for this or for the 
firing of the charge. With him will be sufficient men to 
deal with the first vehicle. 

iv) Rear Party . Must prevent the rear vehicles from backing 
out or otherwise avoiding the trap; and they, together 
with the rear covering party, will prevent the enemy 
guards in the rear vehicles from organising opposition or 
working round behind the attackers. It may be necessary 
to form a second road block to close the trap at the rear 

- the leader will decide whether this is necessary, in 
accordance with the nature of the ground. 

v) The Remainder of the Party will be disposed so as to 

cover the maximum "spread" of vehicles within the limits 
of the trap. Where the exact composition of the convoy is 
known, men should be detailed to deal with each specific 
vehicle, - but never forget that it is impossible to 
determine accurately the point at which each individual 
vehicle will come to a halt. 

Snipers should be included in each group with the primary 
object of picking off: 

- the drivers, 

- any officers 

immediately the convoy has come to a halt. 










270 SOE SYLLABUS 


Weapons . 

i) An L.M.G. . which work independently of detailed orders, 
and which will open fire upon any particular point of 
resistance which appears to be developing. It should be 
sighted to have the maximum field of fire over the whole 
of the ambush area. 

(An anti-tank rifle would be of considerable value but 
is both cumbersome to carry - especially on the 
withdrawal - and also comparatively difficult to 
obtain). 

ii) Rifles for the snipers as detailed above, 

iii) Sub-machine Guns for all members of the party who have a 
direct role of attack upon the vehicles. 

iv) Pistols as reserve weapons (as previously mentioned in 
"Raid Tactics" Lecture). 

v) Grenades . Mills Grenades are useful for dislodging the 
enemy from behind vehicles where they may attempt to 
shelter. The Gammon Grenade should put any lorry or car 
out of action if a direct hit is secured upon the fore 
part. 

vi) Incendiaries . Molotov bottles or phosphorus bombs are 
useful for setting fire to the vehicles. 

6. ACTIQN TQ BE TAKEN WHEN THE CQNVQ Y I g APPROACHED. 

a) The approach is signalled by the look-out - either directly or 
by relay. Signals must previously have been arranged to 
indicate that the convoy is greater or lesser than has been 
expected, and a clear signal that the convoy is unexpectedly 
too great for the attacking force. A different interval 
between the vehicles to that which has been expected should 
also be catered for. 

b) From this moment until the firing of the charge, or dropping 
of the obstacle, every man must keep perfectly still and 
invisible to the enemy. 

c) When the leading vehicle of the convoy proper reaches the 
selected point, the leader will give this order. 

d) The firing of the charge (or placing of obstacle) is the 
signal for general action. Simultaneous fire with all weapons, 
except Mills Grenades, will be opened. Mills Grenades must 
have their own definite and limited time, also on signal from 
the leader, during which the remainder of the party keep under 
cover to avoid casualties from splinters. The snipers will 
concentrate upon drivers and officers, the sub-machine gunners 
upon the enemy guards accompanying the convoy. 

7. ACTION TO BE TAKEN TF ATI. OPPOSITION IS IMMEDIATELY WIPED OUT. 

Anyone approaching the vehicles to carry out a search must be 

detailed for this job by the leader beforehand and he must only 












SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 271 


proceed to the road on the cease fire signal from the leader. He 
must be covered by weapons still in position on the ground. 

There must not be a general stampede down to the road by all the 
attacking force. 

The search party must be speedy and thorough and the searchers 
should be told beforehand what to look for. 

The vehicles can then be set on fire, if tactically advisable, 

a) Will it bring on pursuit? 

b) Is it feasible to take possession of the vehicles? 

8. ACTION TO BE TAKEN IF OPPOSITION DEVELOPS- 

The ambushing force must not fight a pitched battle. Once they 
do, they run the risk of being pinned to the ground by enemy 
fire. 

Hence the leader must have a signal for breaking off the action 
should such a contingency arise, and in his plan he must say what 
action is to be taken in such an event. 

NOTE: At all times scouts must be in position in front and rear 
of ambush to warn of the approach of any traffic or 
assistance. 

9. WITHDRAWAL. 

a) If no opposition develops: As soon as the work is completed 
the party must withdraw to a rendezvous at convenient distance 
from the scene of action. In fixing this rendezvous, the 
leader must envisage the possibility of his party having to 
carry heavy stores taken from the vehicles. These have to be 
hidden not far from the spot and called for at a safer time. 
Also, owing to their weight, particular attention must be paid 
to the likelihood of the party leaving tracks in soft ground, 
or dropping small loose stores that will show the enemy the 
route of withdrawal. A "dog-leg" withdrawal, or even acuter 
change of direction, is advisable where possible. 

b) If opposition develops: Automatic weapons must cover the 
thinning out of the party - e.g. the light machine gunner will 
be the last to withdraw and will attempt to do so unobserved 
by the enemy in order to give himself a few minutes' grace. 
Smoke may be used to advantage, but the wind must be in the 
right direction. 


10. AMBUSHING TROOPS ON THE MARCH. 


As mentioned in the first section of this lecture, it must be 
appreciated that only in certain cases is it worth while to 
ambush troops on the march; i.e. when their destruction will have 







272 SOE SYLLABUS 


an immediate effect. To destroy enemy troops, except in very 
large numbers - which is beyond the scope of the partisan - has 
comparatively small results. 

There may, however, be cases in which the destruction of troops 
would have good results. The following are instances: 

a) If patrols are sent out to attack or locate partisans. 

b) To hold up troops advancing to a definite objective, e.g. 
reserves going into battle. The necessary dispersal on ambush 
will slow them down. 

c) In country districts where there are very few troops (Cf. 
Yugoslavia). 

d) To attack morale, and increase the size of enemy parties when 
they go out. 

The principle remains the same - let the covering force, e.g. 
scouts, etc., through, and attack the main body. Have picked 
snipers to kill off the officers, N.C.O.'s and men with automatic 
weapons. Remember that when passing through a defile the Germans 
very often have flank guards. (Cf. Norway).

attacking, ail en_emy .occupied house 

NOTE: The following lecture deals with an attack by partisans on 
a particular building, e.g., an enemy headquarters, with 
surprise as the principle aim. 

An attack on a house converted into a strong point is more 
in the nature of a military operation when this attack is 
expected, and is therefore not dealt with in this lecture. 

While the attack on an isolated building may form part of an 
operation for the clearing of a village or town it has nothing to 
do with street fighting as such, for which there is a specialised 
drill. 

In attacking any occupied house or any building there are several 
important rules which apply in all cases: 

a) There must be a detailed preliminary reconnaissance of the 
approaches to the house and the house itself. If direct 
personal recce is impossible, a reliable agent's report might 
be accepted. The latter should include, however, an accurate 
sketch. 

b) There must be a definite plan of action to which all must 
adhere. Once the house has been entered complete control of 
the party by the leader is impossible, and therefore everyone 
must know the plan and its object. 

c) If casualties are to be avoided, speed and aggression must be 
used as soon as the action has begun. 

d) As in all guerrilla projects, it is essential that every 
allowance be made by the guerrilla leader for the original 
plan miscarrying. Steps will always be taken in advance to 
overcome difficulties if and when they arise, and the leader 
will always be prepared for the worst. 

1. THE RECONNAISSANCE. 
a) The approaches. 

i) Good cover - if possible coming fairly close up to the 
house, at least near enough for weapons of short effective 
range to be brought to bear on all the exits. 

ii) Good field of fire for all static weapons all round the 
house, controlling all the exits. 

iii) Ground from the point of view of noise - any gravel paths, 
grass verges, lawns, piles of rubbish, noisy gratings, 
obstacles, e.g., buckets, brooms and ash bins. 







274 SOE SYLLABUS 


iv) Surrounding walls, fences, hedges - can they be climbed or 
can a way be made through them? Must ladders be brought, or 
ropes, or are there such things on the spot? 

v) Are there any buildings near which might be used by other 
enemy forces to influence the course of the action? 

vi) From which direction can help come, and in which direction 
will it be impolitic to withdraw? 

vii) Position and numbers of sentries - time of change over - a 
method of patrolling. 

b) The House ., 

Ou t s ide: 

i) Doors - location, and which way do they open? Are they 
usually locked or not? 

ii) Windows - do they open up or down, or on hinges, and if 
the latter, do they open inwards or outwards? How are 
they latched? 

iii) Drain Pipes - leading up to roof or upper stories - 
good ones usually go to the lavatories and the bath 
rooms, and they are generally not locked. 

iv) Gutters along the roof. 

v) Steepness of the roof and layout of the roofing. 
Skylights. 

vi) Are there any outhouses that would help to get on to 
the roof? 

vii) Cellars - low window or coal chute, 

viii) Chimneys - design. 

ix) Balconies and buttresses - for cover and for getting on 
to the roof and the upper floors. 

Inside: 

i) Floor plan - storey by storey. Size of rocms. 

ii) Position of doors and the way they open, 

iii) Staircases - have they any curves? 

iv) Do rooms lead into one another? Are there any large 
built in cupboards? 

v) Layout of the rafters. 

vi) Composition of walls and ceilings. 





SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 275 


vii) Composition of interior - will it burn? 

Much of the above information can be found out by 
observation, but it is obviously much better if you can get 
hold of someone who has been inside the house, or better 
still, the architect or builder. 

When you have this information draw a plan of the house, and 
if possible, get a scale model made. 


The size of the force at your disposal will vary, and it is not 
possible to lay down rules for this, but your force will be 
divided into two parts: 

a) The Covering Party - outside the house. 

b) The Assault or Entry Party - to enter and clear the house. 

Whatever the size of the party, and whether you have the 
advantage of surprise on your side or not, you must have a 
covering party in pQsitjon_before you make a mQv&lt;? against the 

house . 

a) The Covering Party . 

The duties of this force are threefold: 

i) To prevent any help being given to the defenders from the 
outside. 

ii) To kill any enemy who may attempt to leave the house. 

iii) To give the alarm in case of surprise enemy relief. 

Therefore the covering party must be divided into: 

i) Men to give warning of possible enemy reinforcements. 

ii) Men to cover the exits from the house. 

In the plan you will decide as far as possible in which 
direction you intend to drive the enemy, and your will post 
your covering party accordingly. 

But remember that there must be a recognition signal which is 
known to all the party, in order to avoid having your own men 
shot if they should leave the building at any time. 

If there are sentries round the building they must be silently 
eliminated first, or if they have to be shot, the attack must 
coincide with this. In this latter case the first shot fired 
by the sentry killers is the signal for the attack. 





276 SOE SYLLABUS 


Telephone lines on the way in should be cut by someone who 
acts on the sound of the first shot, and not before. 

b) The Assault or Entry Party . 

Again it is impossible to lay down hard and fast rules, but in 
principle it will be composed as follows: 

i) 1 leader. 

ii) Men with automatics to cover the leader, and to cover 
doors inside the house while the attack goes on. 

iii) Bombers. 

This question will be dealt with more fully under the heading 
"How to Enter". 

3. ENTERING THE HOUSE. 

a) Where to Ente_r . 

i) The Front Door - the most likely place for anyone to come in 

- hence - sure to be covered, and may have the guard 
sleeping behind it in the hall, or at any rate a telephone 
orderly or even a sentry. On the other hand, you will get 
immediate control of the hall and the foot of the staircase. 

ii) The Back Door - less likely to be defended, but certain 
to be covered in some way. Entry here should be easier 
than by the front door, and there will probably be better 
cover for the approach. But inside you are not usually in 
a very commanding position immediately. 

iii) Windows - this gives you more choice, but; 

- you cannot enter so quickly, 

- you form an easier target when you enter, 

- you are silhouetted, 

- you must jump down. 

iv) The Roof - if you can get into the house from the roof 
you have a definite advantage because you can drive the 
enemy down and prevent him from rolling grenades down on 
you. But it is very difficult to enter from here unless 
circumstances are particularly favourable, because; 

- It is difficult to get on to the roof. 

- When you are there it is not easy to get in unless 
there is a skylight. 

- You are bound to make some noise when you are getting 
there. 

v) By Explosives - use of H.E. to blast a hole in the wall - 
surprise effect good, but amount of explosive great. 











SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 277 


Conclusion : 

Unless conditions are particularly favourable, or you can 
distract the enemy's attention to allow you to operate from 
the roof, you will have to make your way in on the ground 
floor. The back door is the best place. We shall consider 
entry from the ground floor as the most likely course. 

b) How to Enter . 

i) What size force to use - The force that enters the house 
should not be too large and should be selected according 
to the design of the building and the number of tasks to 
be performed. 

In principle it should consist of the following: 

- 1 leader. 

- 1 bomber. 

- 2 entry or door men. 

- 1 landing man. 

But for a very large house more would be required, 
especially for covering duties. 

ii) Entry by the door - The two entry men take up position on 
either side of the door while the leader and the landing 
man either cover the door from the front (if there is 
adequate cover) or from the side. The bomber is with the 
leader. 

The door is then forced (either kicked or blown open with 
a small charge over the lock). The entry man then throws 
in a grenade and waiting till it explodes they dash into 
the house. 

When they give the signal "Clear" the leader and the rest 
of the party enter. 

When the entry men have crossed the threshold, they must 
not pause in the door way but should slip right and left 
and make their way across the hall to the staircase 
clearing any opposition as they go. Grenades may 
effectively be thrown through appropriate windows. 

iii) Entry by the windows - A similar drill should be used as 
for the door but it is not as good a way of entering for 
reasons already stated. 

iv) Entry by the roof - It is not proposed to outline any 

drill for this because the number of occasions when this 
will be possible in the case of an isolated house are few. 

Should it be attempted the following points should be 
borne in mind: 








278 SOE SYLLABUS 


- An agile man can scale a drain pipe with a rope with 
which he can assist the other members of the party. 

- Use of outhouses. 

- Use of overhanging trees. 

- Ladders found locally or brought by the party, 
i.e. light scaling ladders. 

- Human pyramid. 

But remember that a certain amount of noise is bound to 
be made and your move may be anticipated by the enemy. 

You must also guard against interference from the 
windows. 

On the roof your only feasible means of entry will be 
through a skylight or by using a small charge. 

c) A ctio n Inside the House . 

When the entry has been made from the ground floor, as soon as 
the party has entered, a sentry must be posted at the foot of 
the stairs, covering all the doors on the ground floors and 
the cellars. It may be found better to leave two men here to 
cover your back. 

The remainder of the party with the leader, make their way to 
the top of the house and begin the systematic clearing of the 
house, floor by floor and room by room. 

There are many advantages in operating from the top floor 
downwards: 

i) Everything the attackers throw tends to fall on the 
defenders and everything the defenders throw tends to 
fall back on them. 

ii) Any rushes the attackers make, being in a downward 

direction will give greater velocity to the attack and 
increased momentum, than any similar move made by the 
defenders. 

iii) In a building invested from the bottom the defenders have 
one small chance of escape and will tend to put up a 
stiffer resistance, but when attacked from above, the 
normal means of exit are available and will in all 
probability be used. The covering party will then deal 
with the enemy as they leave the house. 

Staircases . These are very difficult and dangerous because 
grenades can be rolled down on the attackers and it is 
difficult to reply. One man should cover the bottom of the 
staircase while the second dashes up the stairs as far as the 
first bend or the landing. He takes position there and the 
other man either joins him or passes him and makes good the 
next bound. A burst of fire over the head of the moving man 
will help to discourage the enemy. 




SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 279 


Rooms ■ When clearing these the same drill as for entry 
applies. If the man who opens the door finds no opposition the 
leader enters and makes a thorough search. Cupboards and 
locked doors can be dealt with by firing the tommy through the 
wood. It is also a good idea to fire down through the floor. 
This will bring down large lumps of plaster on the heads of 
anyone in the room below. 

Special care must be taken in long corridors with many doors 
not to be cut off or shot in the back. Work along corridors 
room by room. 

When entering a room occupied by an unsuspecting enemy, either 
fling open the door and rush in or throw in a grenade. 

Finally, two points of importance: 

i) When carrying grenades ready for use don't take out the 
pin in order to save time - you may get wounded or fall 
and drop the grenade. 

ii) When you have cleared the house you must have some signal 
to warn the covering party that you are coming out as they 
will not know the result of the attack.

STREET FIGHTING 


January 1944 


INTRODUCTORY REMARKS . 

The general principles of all fighting apply equally to Street 
Fighting, but penalties for mistakes are higher. Therefore, a very 
high standard of efficiency and thoroughness is essential. 

Bear in mind that Street Fighting can be carried on by all arms 
(i.e. tanks, mobile artillery, infantry, aircraft - compare notes on 
the latest events at Stalingrad). Also, no hard and fast rule can be 
laid down as to which level above or below ground may form a 
decisive point in any action, as fighting may be carried out on the 
roofs of houses, upper storeys, at street level, and below street 
level - in sewers and basements. 

No type of warfare demands such a high state of physical fitness and 
endurance as street fighting. All who take part must also be able to 
use, with ease and rapidity, different types of weapons one after 
another. 

There can never be any definite rules in the use of formations and 
weapons in Street Fighting. In view of this, teaching at this school 
will be confined to general advice given on the various points which 
will assist those who might at some time be confronted with this 
type of warfare. They are: 

1. THE AP PREC I ATION. 

It is essential that a proper appreciation be prepared before any 
Commanding Officer can issue orders for the employment, to the 
best advantage, of the troops under his command. You must 
understand that, in both attack and defence, a number of 
principles generally apply, but these two aspects are, of course, 
completely different in their application to Street Fighting. 

a) pgfgngg• 

The following points should be carefully noted: 

i) It will never be possible to defend each building in a 
town of any size. 

ii) Therefore, those buildings which it is decided to defend 
must be carefully chosen to fit in with the general 
scheme of defence. 

iii) The defence must devise suitable means of 
intercommunication. 

iv) Surprise and movement can be employed equally well in 






SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 281 


defence as in attack (there is nothing so demoralising to 
attackers as to find themselves attacked in the rear in 
narrow cramped quarters. 

v) As no prisoners can be taken, life must be sold at its 
dearest. 

b) Attack . 

This should include: 

i) The assumption that the advantage lies with the 
defenders. 

ii) That the attack must aim at surprise, speed, ingenuity, 
and forcefulness. 

iii) That any plan of attack must be sufficiently flexible to 
allow of it being frequently changed. 

iv) That any attack at dawn is generally expected. 

v) That any attack in the evening, just after stand down, is 
likely to succeed with surprise. 

vi) That streets, both main and secondary, will be avenues of 
death, and that approach should generally be made through 
back gardens, alley ways, etc. 

vii) Once several main objectives have been achieved, counter 
attack must be expected. Therefore, all points and 
attacking parties must be consolidated immediately 
objectives are reached. 

2. THE PLAN . 

Taking into account the various factors briefly mentioned above, 
leaders of Street Fighting parties should remember that nothing 
must be left to chance in the planning of either defence or 
attack in this type of warfare. Remember also, that recognition 
signs on clothing, and intercommunication, not only between 
attacking or defending parties, but also with supporting troops 
(if any) who may be able to send reinforcements, are essential. 

Finally, keep all plans for action as simple as possible and make 
sure that the most junior members of these parties understand the 
immediate objective in hand, so that in the event of casualties 
the plan of action will not fail. 

a) DEFENCE . 

It is essential that a proper plan of action is drawn up for 
the defence of any village, town or city, taking into account 
the forces at your disposal. Bear in mind that casualties will 
probably be heavy, and that all points which are still being 





282 SOE SYLLABUS 


held may be cut off and liquidated, one by one. Also take into 
account that very often the best form of defence in Street 
Fighting is attack in the enemy's rear or flank. This can be 
carried out by parties specially hidden in sewers or 
basements, and timed to start on receipt of a pre-arranged 
signal. The method of giving the latter is, of course, open to 
difficulties, as the noise prevalent in street Fighting is 
shattering, and sound signals will rarely be heard. Some other 
method, therefore, should be employed. 

It should not be difficult, provided there is time, to make 
certain that strong points are suitably prepared against enemy 
attack, isolated buildings standing in their own grounds form 
an easy target in Street Fighting. It is more likely that the 
most easily defended buildings are those upon which the enemy 
stumbles unexpectedly, and against which there is not much 
covered approach where the enemy can use surprise. Basements 
are usually excellent places, if properly strengthened by pit 
props, sandbags and stones. If on the corners of streets these 
command many areas of approach, and can be used as deadly 
obstacles in the path of the enemy, provided adequate fire 
power is available. 

Remember that in attack the enemy will almost certainly use 
smoke, and therefore, in choosing any particular point bear in 
mind that there may be a prevailing wind which will blow smoke 
back upon the advancing enemy. It is also essential that 
economy of fire power be preserved, and that an advancing 
enemy be fired upon only at the last moment, so that it is 
quite certain that the attackers will be killed to a man if 
fire is brought to bear upon them. 

A machine gun firing aimlessly down the street would only give 
the defending position away to the attackers, who may be under 
cover. 

Camouflage also plays a very important part in the preparation 
of strong points, and if used with intelligence, can often 
result in the complete ambush of the enemy. Remember also that 
all weapons should never be sighted on the same level, and 
that smoke will hang low; therefore, it may be of advantage to 
have some automatic weapons sighted high up on a building. 

Remember also that if it is possible, buildings which are 
likely to be singled out by the enemy as objectives should be 
mined as a trap. 

It is also essential that each man, as far as possible, shall 
be a self-contained unit. He should have with him his weapons, 
his ammunition, and above all, he should carry as many rations 
as he can within reason; no street fighter can afford to leave 
his post because "the rations have not arrived". 

Finally, good team work, and the ability to fight on when cut 
off will very often turn seeming defeat into victory. 



SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 283 


b) ATTACK . 

The first principle to remember in Street Fighting attacks is 
that the enemy will be expecting you . Therefore, unless the 
force with which you are attacking consists of large numbers 
of tanks and other heavy weapons (and these we will not deal 
with here), you must employ surprise and ingenuity to the 
fullest advantage to achieve success. 

Secondly, make absolutely certain that the signals or signs by 
which you give your orders for the attack and for co¬ 
ordinating your advance are heard and understood by all 
concerned. There have been in the past various schools of 
thought which deal with a recognised drill for the clearing of 
houses. This is not always possible without a very great deal 
of practice among regular troops, and therefore various 
methods must be considered, and not just a detailed plan of 
attack which may not apply, such as is laid down for regular 
troops. Remember that if you are going to use smoke it must be 
used in circumstances when it is advantageous to you and not 
to the enemy. 

Make absolutely certain that the maximum amount of your fire 
power is used intelligently, and in a concentrated form, i.e., 
that it is brought to bear upon the objective which you are 
attacking. Covering fire, of course, must play a very 
important part in all attacks of this kind, and all taking 
part in Street Fighting, should be trained so that they will 
not be deceived by camouflaged enemy strong points. To develop 
a good eye for detecting these points is not easy, but it 
should be stressed that they are points which need careful 
consideration. 

Note carefully the following points in clearing a house. 

Houses should, if possible, be cleared from the roof downwards 
for two reasons: 

i) Gravity fights on your side. 

ii) A cornered enemy must fight. Therefore drive him towards 
the door rather than towards the roof. 

Drill for entering a suspected house from ground level . 

i) Place covering fire. Targets to include: 

- Windows, Loopholes, etc. of the house itself. 

- Windows, Loopholes, etc. of adjacent house. 

ii) Party of 5 men, (commander, bomber, 2 entry men, 

1 landing man). 

Two entry men take up positions one on each side of 
chsoen means of entry. 






284 SOE SYLLABUS 


— *If by door or windoe it is forced or smashed in. 

— *One entry man throws bomb in. 

— Both enter. 

— If room is clear or when they have dared it the 
commander is signalled to aproach by a shout of 
CLEAR. 


iii) Commander, bomber and landing man rush in. Landing man 
takes up position to cover stair or landing while 
commander and bomber make their way to top of house and 
commence search. Entry men search cellar (if any) and 
ground floor rooms. As the commander makes his way to top 
of house a burst of fire through the door, wall or 
ceiling of a suspected room has the effect of rattling 
any occupants and if fired down to a room usually has the 
effect of bringing down the ceiling on top of the 
occupants and setting up a thick cloud of dust. 

NOTE: Should entry be forced by an explosive agency 
Drills ii) marked * may be omitted. 

3. SPEC IA L NO TE ON W E APONS- 

a) Do not forget that the defenders will, by using rifles and 
automatic rifles, whether firing from the rooftops and upper 
windows or from ground level, have the advantage over an 
attack based only on S.M.G. fire power. Therefore, whilst a 
percentage of S.M.G.s is essential for close-quarter fighting 
in the houses, etc. rifles and automatic rifles are also 
essential in order to prevent the attack being "outranged". 

b) The safety pin should never be drawn from a Mills bomb or 
similar grenade until immediately before it is thrown. Many 
casualties have been caused by a man being badly wounded 
whilst carrying a grenade with the pin out. The grenade falls 
from his hand, and he is unable to deal with it. 

OBSERVATION IN PARTISAN WARFARE 

1. INTRODUCTION - THE IMPORTANCE OF OBSERVATION . 

The secret of every successful operation is detailed and accurate 
information. Whereas in regular warfare such information is 
generally forthcoming from a higher formation, and the fighting 
unit has little chance to verify its accuracy, in irregular 
warfare the responsibility must rest upon the band itself. The 
observation cannot be too detailed - some small detail of the 
enemy's habits may prove to be the deciding factor when it comes 
to the actual operation. 

2. CHECK-UP ALWAYS NECESSARY . 

Information may become out-of-date very quickly. Therefore, no 
matter how trustworthy your information is or even if you 
yourself have reconnoitred and observed some days previously, a 






SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 285 


final "check-up" reconnaissance is always necessary. When a 
partisan band have themselves made the reconnaissance a day or 
two prior to the operation, the leader will make this final 
"check-up" as late as possible - sometimes on the operation 
itself. In this case he leaves the rest of the party a short 
distance back and goes forward to his "recce point", to satisfy 
himself that nothing has changed since the first observation was 
carried out. 

3. OTHER TIMES WHEN OBSERVATION MUST BE CARRIED OUT . 

Besides the reconnaissance of the target area and the route to 
it, observation will frequently be necessary during the actual 
movement of the party. Particularly, it is necessary at the end 
of each "bound", to ensure that there is no enemy on the ground 
which the party is about to cross. The value of surprise must lie 
with the agent and_ not with the enemy , and when such observation 
is not carefully carried out, a whole party may stumble into the 
arms of the enemy. In such cases, when you are examining the 
ground for the presence of human beings, look first for movement , 
because it is most easily seen. Next, look carefully at anything 
that is darker than its surroundings, and lastly, look at 
anything that is much lighter than its surroundings or is of a 
very different colour. If you are suspicious of an object - take 
no chances, wait until your mind is made up. Never spend less 
than three minutes in observation - a quick glance is useless, 
and merely lulls into what may be a sense of false security. 

4. SEE WITHOUT BEING SEEN . 

To the agent there is little use in being able to see the enemy 
if the enemy can also see him. Most people have thought of the 
unlimited possibilities for observation that would be open to an 
"Invisible Man", and this is what the agent must try to be. 

It is often possible to hide one's body behind something when 
observing, but unless the head itself is in view, you will not be 
able to see and might as well be back at home with a glass of 
whisky. Therefore, the importance of the camouflage of the head 
cannot be over-estimated . It is sufficient to remember that 
without such camouflage close quarter observation is virtually 
impossible. If there is a secret of successful observation, this 
is it. 

There are other details besides camouflage which are of great 
help. When possible, observation should be done round . not over, 
cover, and the head should be kept at ground level . The human eye 
is unconsciously most receptive of movement at its own level 
above the ground, and movement much lower or much higher than 
this (i.e. at ground level or in trees) is frequently overlooked. 
Opportunities for observation from trees are comparatively few, 
and ground level has therefore the most general application. The 
head, then, should be kept as close as possible to the ground 
when observing round cover, and only just enough of it exposed to 
allow observation - it is quite unnecessary to expose the whole 















286 SOE SYLLABUS 


head. If the head is not camouflaged, the exposed part of it 
should be protected by a bunch of herbage held before it. If, 
however, it is moving about much, no camouflage in the world will 
prevent its detection. It is of the greatest importance that the 
head should be kept as still as is humanly possible, and when 
movement is necessary it should be done extremely slowly, an inch 
or less at a time. Remember, also, the rest of your body, and if 
you are lying down do not raise your feet over your back in order 
to get a change of position when you are getting stiff. 

Any object of regular outline should be avoided as a place from 
which to observe - anything protruding from a smooth surface is 
very easily seen. During the last war it took the British a year 
to find this out - their trench parapets were beautifully regular 
and smooth, while the Germans' were rough and uneven and untidy, 
with many pieces of rubbish, old tin cans, loose sandbags, etc. 
scattered about on them. 

5. ARTIFICIAL AIDS TO OBSERVATION . 

Binoculars, or a telescope, are a great help in all observation. 

A less obvious aid, but one that is even more useful, is a 
periscope, and where it is possible for the agent to acquire one, 
he should always do so. There are many varieties of periscope, 
the simplest of which - an arrangement of small mirrors of highly 
polished metal surfaces on a stick - can be home-made. At the 
other end of the scale are the periscope monoculars, giving a 
magnification of up to x 6. These were chiefly made for trench 
warfare, but it is possible that some are still in existence in 
the German Army. It is well worth while to construct a home-made 
periscope. 

6. "IF £NL Y _ WE . HAD . . MORE I NFO RM AT ION 

The items in a target area which will have the greatest bearing 
upon the operation are tactical considerations, and are fully 
dealt with in lectures on Appreciation and Planning. But it must 
be emphasized again that no detail is too small to be worth 
recording mentally, or in writing if the information is for the 
use of others. Things that at first sight may appear entirely 
insignificant suddenly assume a major importance when the plan is 
being made. If the slogan of "Know your enemy" can be directed at 
regular troops, how much more must it apply to the agent, who 
must always face an overwhelming numerical superiority. He must 
rely upon surprise and a detailed knowledge of the enemy to 
counteract that superiority. 

For the same reason, anything that is not fully understood must 
be observed and investigated until it is. If in the last war the 
first people to see gas-containing cylinders had investigated 
their purpose, the first gas attacks would have lost much of 
their terrible surprise value. 





SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 287 


However painstaking the individual, his information from 
observation will be incomplete if he is unable to recognise the 
common military signs and symbols used by the enemy. If, for 
instance, a certain village is known to contain battle H.Q. of a 
German Division, it would be extremely difficult for the observer 
to distinguish it from the Brigade H.Q., which might be housed 
two doors away from it or across the street - unless he is able 
instantly to recognise the military symbol at the entrance to the 
house. 

8. O BS ERV AT IO N REPORT S .■ 

An observation report made for the use of someone else should be 
made out in this form. On the first sheet, a sketch map of the 
area under observation. Each feature of importance should be 
numbered to correspond with a key at the foot of the map - this 
is better than writing on the map itself, which is apt to become 
confusing and obscured. Next, write a general description of the 
area leaving out such details as you have already made clear from 
the map. This description should deal with 'constant' factors - 
features, that is, that would be the same at any time of the day, 
not individual enemy actions that have been noticed, when this is 
completed, give your page a marginal column, and enter the times 
at which various actions or activities have been noted, 
describing the activity opposite to the time. If you are drawing 
deductions, other than obvious ones, state that they are your 
deductions, and do not represent them as proven fact. In 
describing the position of these activities, it is possible to 
refer to the sketch map, in this manner: "1455 hrs. The head of a 
German officer was visible in the window at point 'o', or "1515 
hrs. Two private soldiers left the door at point 'f' and entered 
the latrines at point 'd'. They then left the observation area by 
the gate at point 'x'." 

The report should not be long-winded, but make quite certain that 
you do not sacrifice clarity and accuracy to brevity. 

This type of observation report is intended to enable someone 
else to attack a stationary target guarded by the enemy. 

Observation reports dealing with movements of troops, vehicles, 
etc. must answer the following questions: 

a) When, (date and time). 

b) Where, (as exactly as possible). 

c) What and how many. i.e. 14 Mk. IV tanks. 

d) Direction and estimated speed, i.e. N.E. at 20 k.p.h; or 
towards 'Y' along road 'X - Y'. 

e) Any other details. (As in other types of observation, no 
detail which time allows is too small to be of importance. 

Finally, Negative information, i.e. that no enemy A.F.V's. were 
observed in such and such an area - is equally important.

PRINCIPLES OF CAMOUFLAGE. CONCEALMENT AND 

DISGUISE - I 


1. INTRODUCTORY . 

As the word 'camouflage' is used in ordinary conversation, it 
covers pretty well all methods of deceiving the enemy, and is 
thus a very general term. In order to do a thing well, it is 
necessary to understand exactly what one is trying to do, and for 
this reason we sub-divide the general term 'camouflage' into 
three separate headings. These headings are: 

Camouflage proper; 

Disguise; 

Concealment. 


2. DEFINITIONS : 

Camouflage proper is often called the "general resemblance". That 
is to say that you deceive the enemy by melting into or mingling 
with your background, and are no longer noticeable at all. 
Example: the white 'snow-sniper's' suits used in Russia and 
Finland. 

Disguise is often called the "special resemblance". That is to 
say that you deceive the enemy, although he does actually see 
you, because he mistakes you for some harmless or unimportant 
object. Example: The most obvious example is the German 
parachutists' use of nuns' and other female clothing. Less 
obvious, but still disguise, a man dressed in grey clothing may, 
in a country such as this, pass for a rock, even though he is not 
very near any other rocks. If you consider the number of objects 
in any countryside which a man could make himself resemble, it 
will be clear that disguise has almost as wide an application as 
camouflage proper. 

Concealment is to hide behind something, so that you are actually 
cut off from view. No example is required, and since a man who is 
entirely concealed is somewhat functionless, we shall not discuss 
it further. 

Having defined these words, it will be clear at once that all 
three methods can be used by a man simultaneously. For example: 
he may disguise his head as a small gorse bush, camouflage his 
body to disappear altogether, and conceal his feet behind 
something. But unless he knows this himself, he is liable to 
'fall between two stools' and achieve nothing. 













SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 289 


3. METHODS OF ACHIEVING THESE RESULTS . 

a) Camouflage proper . 

To the partisan, by far the most general application of 
camouflage proper is the use of background, as already broadly 
outlined in the lecture "Movement by Day". Get into the habit 
of thinking constantly of your background, and if there are 
others dressed as you are, notice against what backgrounds 
they appear to be invisible and against which backgrounds they 
look obvious. If you concentrate on this, you will find that 
almost unconsciously you choose, the whole time, backgrounds 
most like the clothes you are wearing. Where there is no 
background that is very like your clothes, use natural 
camouflage - that is, leaves, grass, heather, branches, etc. - 
to cover partially and break up the colour mass of your body. 
Pockets, button-holes, waist-band, collar - all these can 
receive and hold pieces of vegetation which will partially 
obscure your clothes and help you to mingle with your 
background. (When using natural camouflage, remember that 
under a hot sun it withers quickly, and may be worse than 
useless at the end of a few hours.) 

The whole question of colour in camouflage is extremely 
complicated, but there is one salient fact that should be 
remembered. The works of man are immediately recognisable by 
their regularity in colour, and also in outline. If you were 
to look at a garden lawn and were asked what its colour was, 
you would reply 'green'. But while green is certainly the 
predominant colour, you will find if you look more closely 
that there are not only many different shades of green, but 
also many other colours - browns, yellows, dark patches of 
shadow, etc. Remember, therefore, solid colours always look 
suspicious . 

Besides the question of colour, there are three more factors 
which make an object recognisable for what it is. These are: 

i) Shape in the flat, or outline, 

ii) Shape in depth. 

iii) Tone - that is, how light or how dark an object is. 

These are considered in detail below: 

i) Shape in the flat . This is determined by outline, or 
outside edge. If you cannot see the outside edges of the 
object, it becomes much more difficult to recognise. 

There are two general ways of destroying outline. One is 
to break up the outline by patches of different colours, 
so that it does not appear as a continuous line. This is 
usually called "disruptive painting", and is used on 
buildings such as aerodrome hangers, etc., as well as on 
camouflaged clothing. Note, however, that it is useless 
if it is just patches of colour on the bulk of the 
object: it must break up the outline itself ■ The other 
method is by adding on to the outline protruberances and 








290 SOE SYLLABUS 


irregularities that destroy the shape. On a man, this is 
best done with natural camouflage - leaves or branches or 
tufts of grass, etc. While on the subject of outline, 
remember that it is often possible to make the outline of 
your body and limbs resemble the outline of the objects 
around you, with very good effect. For example - rocks do 
not have branches, therefore when among rocks keep your 
arms close to your body. Trees do, and it is often 
possible to make your arms look like branches of a 
standing tree or roots of a fallen one. This is worthy of 
much more thought than it usually receives. Up a tree you 
will find about the best hiding place of all, as 
suprisingly few people ever look up into the trees they 
pass under. But here again, the outline of your body must 
be made to follow and resemble the outline of the trunk 
and its branches. Even a bare tree can be a good hiding 
place if this is remembered. 

ii) Shape in depth . This is what makes an object appear solid 
- and is dependent upon SHADOWS and high lights. They 
are, in fact, the only factors that make a white marble 
statue recognisable from a white paper silhouette. 

Shadows are the most difficult problem in the whole of 
camouflage, whether of man or an aeroplane factory, and 
always seem to find some way to reveal the true shape of 
the object, do what one will. But once their vast 
importance is realised half the battle is won. 

Look at the man who is lying on the ground, or standing 
against a wall. Wherever his body touches the ground or 
the wall on the opposite side from which the light is 
coming there is a shadow, wherever there is a furrow in 
his clothing there is a shadow - there is a shadow 
between his arms and his body, between his legs, under 
his chin, and so on. These shadows give him his shape - 
if they were not there he would appear to have no arms, 
only one thick leg — in fact he would become less and 
less like a man. It is for this reason that "snipers' 
suits" are made as cloaks, without arms or legs - so that 
there shall be no specifically human, and therefore 
betraying appendages. 

Now, one golden rule applies. The flatter an object, the 
less shadow it gives; therefore an object with sloping 
sides gives much less shadow than one with straight 
sides. Try this with a match-box, with a strong light 
coming from one side. Then bend out one side till it is 
at a gentle slope - there will be no shadow at all. 

It is for this reason that large buildings that are to be 
camouflaged so as to disappear into the landscape are 
built with sloping sides - were they not, their shadows 
would betray them. The same applies to the camouflage of 
a man. 



SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 291 


It will be seer, immediately that the closer a man presses 
himself against the ground or background he intends to 
blend with, the less shadow he will cast, and the more he 
will tend to disappear. Similarly, if his arms are 
pressed to his sides, there is less room for shadow that 
would fall between his arms and body if the latter were 
hanging loosely, or if his hands were folded on his lap. 
Again, a man sitting with his legs stretched out on the 
ground in front of him will be less visible if his legs 
are flat on the ground than if his knees are slightly 
drawn up. Ruckles in clothing, like, for example, the 
ruckle formed by a battle-dress blouse at the waist also 
cast a black shadow. If you are going to take up a 
position from which to observe, for instance, try to 
arrange both yourself and your clothing so that the 
absolute minimum of shadows are formed - and think where 
those shadows are likely to be. Some grass, heather, or 
other vegetation, is extremely useful to fill up these 
spaces where the shadows would fall, if you are to remain 
in one position for any length of time. 

iii) Tone . This is often more important than colour, 

especially at a distance. An object of unusual colour is 
usually spotted at once because it is also of an unusual 
tone. Some extraordinarily bright colours can pass 
unnoticed if they are of exactly the same tone as their 
background - that is to say, if they would appear neither 
lighter nor darker in a photograph. As most backgrounds 
are much lighter in tone that one suspects, make it a 
general rule to keep a dark background whenever you can. 
You are usually seen because you are darker than your 
background. 


PRINCIPLES QF CAMOUFLAGE, CONCEALMENT AND 
DISGUISE - II 


1. MSSIZJSE. 

Having realised that disguise is not necessarily a matter of 
wearing a false red beard or getting a stage cow, its 
possibilities increase considerably. But it will also be obvious 
that there are very, very few objects that are suitable for the 
disguise of a man's body in movement . and a man is much more 
often moving than stationary. 

The chief application of the "special resemblance" therefore, is 
for use on the head only . As discussed in the lecture 
"Observation", it is often easy to hide the body behind something 
(conceal it), but a man is usually somewhat useless if his hand 
is also concealed. 

Now is the time to realise that camouflage proper can very rarely 
be used satisfactorily on the head - it must be disguised. That 
is to say, it is very difficult to make the head blend into and 










292 SOE SYLLABUS 


mingle with its background - especially at close quarters, which 
is the range from which you should always try to observe - but it 
is comparatively easy to make it look like something completely 
different. This 'something different' may be anything from a 
small bush or a moss-covered stone to a tiny bucket or a pile of 
horsedung. One of the simplest of all means of disguise of the 
head is a sheet of moss, such as grows round trees roots, on 
stones, etc. It has two great advantages. 

a) It is to be found everywhere in the world where there are 
either large trees or rocks; 

b) It requires no making or work, as it can be taken off the 
ground as a solid sheet that will cover the whole head - a 
ready-made hat. Its use, among other types of camouflage and 
disguise, can be easily practised in this area. 

If the head is to be disguised as a bush, let it be as large a 
bush as comfort and weight will allow. Every hat worn for 
operational purposes should be capable of receiving natural 
camouflage, that is to say it must have holes, or string, into 
which vegetation, etc. can be inserted or tied. This vegetation 
must not only completely cover the hat, but must also completely 
break up the outline of the head, by adding on to it. A large 
bush looks much less likely to be a man's head than something 
that is exactly the size and shape of a man's head. 

Other methods of improving the disguise of the head are discussed 
later in this lecture under the heading of artificial camouflage. 

2. ARTIF I CIAL CAMOUFLAGE . 

Artificial Camouflage, as applied to a man, was first developed 
for the use of snipers. We have already seen that it is 
impossible to render a moving object completely invisible by 
camouflage, and the sniper is one of the few men in regular 
warfare whose job it is to keep quite still. 

Because of the shadow difficulties already discussed, snipers' 
suits soon gave place to snipers' cloaks, or to sheets under 
which a man could lie. In this way, the shadows which define a 
man's limbs were eliminated. These cloaks and sheets were 
sometimes very elaborate, and required long preparation, such as 
pouring molten rubber over the surface with which the sniper was 
required to blend, and then making the dried and painted rubber 
into a cloak. 

All these methods are beyond the scope and opportunity of the 
partisan, but there are two simple forms of artificial camouflage 
which are well worth study and are within the opportunity of 
everybody. 

The first of these is the sheet made of sacking. It is remarkably 
effective, frequently more so than the more elaborate types, and 
is very easy to construct. Sandbags, cut open and sewn together, 




SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 293 


form the basis. The sheet should be about 8' long and 4' wide, 
and the edges should be made ragged so that there will be a less 
obvious line where the sheet joins the ground. Next, rub the 
sheet thoroughly in the soil of the piece of country in which it 
is to be used, so that bare patches upon it will appear to be 
bare patches of soil. Then sew or tie on to it pieces of grass or 
other vegetation typical of the country. When used where there 
are sparsely vegetated patches of soil, this is extremely 
invisible, is easily carried rolled up. Since vertical surfaces 
always cast most shadow, the sheet must be drawn well away from 
the body at sides, not tucked in round the man, as is often the 
first instinct. 

A variation of the above is a sheet which is entirely covered with 
vegetation down to the last inch, and is therefore completely 
indistinguishable from the ground around it when it is laid out 
like a carpet. In this case the sewing on the vegetation must be 
done on the spot, and the sheet is left spread out flat when its 
user leaves his observation post after dusk. Care must be taken 
that vegetation used does not wither quickly. Such a sheet is not 
easily portable, but in most types of ground it is entirely 
invisible, and can be treated as a static observation post. 

It will be immediately obvious that this principle of sacking 
camouflage can be applied with great effect and much less labour 
to the camouflage or disguise of the head alone. In this case, a 
sort of balaclava helmet is made of the sacking, and it is 
completely covered with vegetation sewn on to it, or with a sheet 
of moss as previously described under the heading of disguise. 
When used as a 'lining' to the moss it has the advantage of 
excluding insects. 

A second type of artificial camouflage within the opportunity of 
the partisan is the use of camouflage truck nets. These are 
common to all belligerent armies, and vary little in type. In 
principle, they consist of string netting dyed green or parti¬ 
coloured, and hessian tape in various colours (called in the 
British Army 'scrim') is provided to tie on in short lengths to 
represent leaves, and to break up the general colour mass. Truck 
nets are remarkably easily stolen, and have a wide application. 
They can be used as is the sheet to camouflage a man lying down, 
can be draped over him among vegetation while he is in a standing 
position, can be used to camouflage any object that must remain 
in the open and be invisible to the enemy, or can be used as a 
screen through which to fire an L.M.G., for example, when 
ambushing a convoy. Their effectiveness is out of all proportion 
to their simplicity and ease of use, and are worth much 
consideration in irregular warfare. 

Of the same principle as net camouflage are veils to cover the face, 
which have already been discussed in the lecture "Movement by Day". 

There is no reason why ingenuity should not improve on these few 
types of simple artificial camouflage, but it must be remembered 
that the partisan does not have access to unusual materials.

THE VSE AND CARE QF BINOCULAR? 


Gj.8 

January 1944 


1. INTRODUCTORY . 

Binoculars are an aid, but not an essential, to good observation. 
The partisan should always aim at close personal observation, but 
where, for instance, heavy perimeter fences make this impossible, 
a more sketchy reconnaissance by binocular at greater distance, 
must take its place. The more you know about the use of 
binoculars, the less sketchy such reconnaissance will be. 

2. THE BINOCULARS THEMSELVES . 

Binoculars differ from telescopes in that they are "prismatic", 
that is to say that the light required is refracted through 
prisms instead of passing direct through a number of lenses of 
varying power. Thus it is possible to use a pair of binoculars on 
a day which would be too dark to see well with a telescope. There 
are also prismatic "monoculars" - glasses for one eye only - but 
here again the effect of light is less than in a glass where both 
eyes can be used. 

In partisan warfare, the opportunities to 'acquire' binoculars 
are large. But the partisan has no room for useless souvenirs, 
and must know what is worth taking and what is not. 

Binoculars are made in many qualities and magnifications, by many 
different makers. Some of them cure not worth having at all, and 
the very small non-prismatic binoculars usually called 'opera 
glasses' are quite useless for our purposes. The best English 
makers of binoculars are Ross and Kershaw (separate firms), the 
best German are Carl Zeiss and Dalmeyer (also separate firms). 

Binoculars are made in magnifications from 4 to 25 - anything 
smaller than 4 being in the nature of an 'opera glass'. The 
natural tendency in most inexperienced people would be to plump 
for the 25, in that they could remain more than five times 
further away from the enemy than if they plumped for the 4. But 
there are other equally important considerations. 

The main factors are these: 

a) How much do they magnify? 

b) How much light do they let in - that is, how easy to see with 
are they on a dark day? This factor is called the "light 
equivalent". 

c) How large are they? Are they easy to carry? 

Now we immediately come up against an important consideration - 





296 SOE SYLLABUS 


the greater the magnification the less the "light equivalent" and 
the more bulky and awkward are the glasses to carry. So perhaps 
the 25's are not the best after all. 

Most binoculars - all good ones - have their dimensions written 
somewhere on them, usually on the 'shoulder', and they are 
written in this manner: 


8 x 25 
or 

10 x 50 

The first figure is the number of magnifications, the second is 
the number of millimetres across the object glass (the big lense 
at the opposite end from the eye-piece). The "light equivalent" 
is obtained by dividing the first figure into the second and 
squaring the result. Thus the "light equivalents" of the examples 
are 9.5 (approx.) and 25. The greater the "light equivalent" the 
more use the binoculars are under poor light conditions. Those 
with very low "light equivalent" are only useful in bight sunny 
weather. 

So we see that to have a high "light equivalent" there must be a 
large object glass, and that immediately makes for bulk. These 
are the problems which confront both the makers of binoculars and 
the partisan leader who would equip his band. Were they more 
generally understood there would be less grumbling over the 
quality of binoculars issued to Armies. 

Try, then, for the glass of medium dimensions - a magnification 
of 8 or 10 and a "light equivalent" of not less than, say, 10, 
and the higher the better as long as the glass is still easily 
portable. The Carl Zeiss light-weight 10 x 50, carried by many 
German officers, may be said to be the ideal binocular for 
general purposes. The peace-time price of these in England was 
something over £50, and in the first years of this war they were 
changing hands at over £100. 

3. FOCUSSING . 

Binoculars are focussed by a small wheel, which is usually 
central, between the eye-pieces, but may be on each eye-piece 
separately. A third variation is that in which the central wheel 
focusses the right eye only, and the left eye is focussed by 
screwing the eye-piece itself. In all cases it is useful to put a 
small mark showing where the "infinity" focus for your own 
eyesight is. 

4. THE CARE OF BINOCULARS . 

a) All good binocular lenses are made of highly polished glass 
which is soft . This high polish is essential if the best 
results are to be obtained, and it can only be retained by 
careful cleaning. Thus, a piece of chamois leather, silk, or 
well-washed 4x2 should always be carried either in the 






SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 297 


binocular case or the pocket-book, and used for this purpose. 
First flick off the dust that may be on the outside of the 
glass, then clean with a gentle circular motion. Never touch 
the glass with finger or thumb. 

b) If the glass is allowed to get damp, fogging inside the lenses 
will result. To cure this, lay it in the sun or in a warm 
room, but do not let the metal get hotter than body 
temperature, or the Canadian balsam which fixes the lenses in 
most high class binoculars will melt and the glasses will fail 
to focus properly. When working parts get wet, they must be 
dried and slightly lubricated before the glasses are put away. 
Rifle oil will do for this purpose. 

c) Unless there are very special reasons for it, don't use your 
binoculars under conditions which are certain to get them wet. 
They may become useless before you have learnt what you want 
to know, and they will be useless for some time. 

d) Carry binoculars on your person , either in their case or in a 
clean pocket. Dust and dirt must be kept from the lenses. Keep 
them on your body when travelling in lorries, etc. - jolting 
shifts the prisms and destroys accurate focussing. 

e) Never attempt to strip binoculars, unless you are an expert. 

5. SPYING WITH BINOCULARS . 

a) Steadiness : Always use a rest when you can, it is most 
important to keep the glasses steady. If you cannot rest the 
glasses on anything, press the edges of the eye-pieces against 
the top of the eye-sockets (not enough to cause discomfort). 
This gives a steadier result than is otherwise possible 
without resting the glasses. Every man must suit himself with 
regard to position. When you cannot rest the glasses, try to 
get both your elbows on to your knees, to form a tripod. A man 
will very rarely spy standing up unless his is observing over 
cover, when he will be able to rest the glasses. 

b) Technique of searching around : When searching a given sector 
of ground, divide it into fields of view - don't let your eyes 
wander aimlessly over it. Work slowly, allowing each field to 
overlap. Do not pass on from any unexpected or unusual object 
without trying to find out what it is and why it is there. 

Don't look at the same object for too long. If you can't make 
something out, rest your eyes, and look away from it and then 
look back quickly. On the other hand, don't give it up because 
you have not been able to make it out the first time. Light 
conditions are constantly changing, and what was invisible at 
1100 hours may be quite plain at 1105. The keenest vision is at 
the edge of the eye - do not keep the object you are studying 
in the centre of the field of view. Visibility is best after 
rain, owing to the refraction of light from raindrops. 

c) Binoculars cannot give the same perspective as the naked eye. 







298 SOE SYLLABUS 


and the following points, which are caused by this slight 
distortion, must be remembered: 

i) "Dead" ground is not easily distinguishable, i.e. glasses 
have the effect of flattening out the ground. 

ii) Distances between objects in line ahead appear smaller than 
they really are. 

iii) Distances between objects in line abreast appear greater 
than they really are. 

d) DANGER ! 

If you don't make some sort of a shade to cover the object glass, 
your position will be given away to the enemy in sunny weather by 
the flash. Its size must vary with the size of the object glass. 
Make them with paper, cardboard, or anything more permanent that 
you are able to get. When nothing is available, the hands can be 
cupped to form an extension to each object glass, but this is not 
entirely satisfactory.

PROTECTION OF RAILWAYS AND ROADS 

The number and strength of guard troops and sentry posts depends on 
the number of bridges, tunnels, etc., to be guarded and the nature 
of the terrain. Under average conditions a battalion is necessary 
per 100 kilometres of track or road, of which 2 men are required per 
kilometre for local protection, with the remainder on patrol duty or 
acting as reserves. 

Each company takes over a given section, piquets of 2 N.C.O.s. and 
10 men being entrusted with the protection of specific points (the 
N.C.O.s. relieving one another, with 9 men for sentry duty and 
reliefs and 1 man in reserve for special duties). 

Heavy weapons are distributed among the various sub-units. 

Battalion and company commanders' headquarters are usually located 
with the reserves in the centre of each section. Piquets and 
reserves occupy strong points with a good field of fire and 
protected by barbed wire. In guarding railways a locomotive coupled 
to a truck is held ready at the strongpoints garrisoned by the 
reserves; in the case of roads, M.T., from which all baggage has 
been cleared, is kept ready at these points. 

Vital point such as bridges are guarded by a single sentry by day and 
by double sentries at night. In the case of long bridges or of tunnels 
sentries are posted at either end, while covering parties may be 
employed too where dead ground conceals the approaches. Extra sentries 
may be posted below the bridges at night time (at the bridge piers). 

Energetic patrolling is carried out by day on both sides of the road 
or railway - sometimes with cyclist patrols. Foot patrols make 
contact with one another during the night by moving along the 
permanent way* or keeping to the roadway. 

Special attention is given to testing fish plates, bolts and rail 
joints and a good look-out is kept for explosives secured to the 
inner flanges of rails and for any disturbances of the ballast such 
as would indicate the laying of mines. 

Draisines are at times employed for purposes of inspection or for 
supplying posts. An armoured draisine is sometimes sent ahead of 
transport trains instead of a pilot engine. 

If sufficient troops are available, patrols are sent off deep into 
the country on either side of the railway or road to search villages 
and question their inhabitants. (This practice appears to have 

* A band of partisans specialising in track destruction on the 
Leningrad front recently gave a quarter of an hour as the interval of 
time elapsing between the passing of sentries.

arisen as a result of the order given to partisans not to withdraw 
more than 20 kms. from the main lines of communication). 

Crops or woods adjacent to railways and capable of affording cover 
to guerrillas are often burnt or cut down to a width of 200 yds. or 
so from either side of the line. Farms adjacent to the railway may 
for the same reason be evacuated or burnt down. The inhabitants of 
villages adjacent to the railways are made responsible for 
safeguarding the line in their neighbourhood.

Appendix II 
February 1944 


INTERCOMMUNICATION IN THE FIELD 

The best plan may be made ineffectual by an insufficient amount of 
attention being paid to the question of intercommunication. 

The subject is of paramount importance to both regular and irregular 
forces but it presents far greater difficulties to the latter, 
since, in most cases, stealth and silence are their watchwords by 
day and by night. 

In every partisan operation it is absolutely necessary that the 
leader should, in making up his orders, visualise in advance every 
possible occasion and circumstance when it may be necessary for 
himself or any member of the party to communicate with any one or 
more of the remainder; he must be satisfied that the signals 
arranged are adequate under all circumstances and known to all who 
may need them. 

THE TWO MAIN TYPES OF SIGNALS . 

All signals that will require to be given during a partisan 
operation can be roughly divided into two types: 

a) Those which need not be concealed from the enemy. 

b) Those which must not warn the enemy of the presence of the users. 
TYPE (a) . 

The signals falling into this category are those which start a noisy 
action, those which are given during it continuance, and those which 
mark its end. 

Signals of this type do not usually present serious difficulties. 

The signal for the opening of the action may, for instance, be a 
shot or a blast on a whistle. The main consideration is that some 
action on the part of the enemy shall not be mistaken for the 
leader's signal, e.g. all German sentries are equipped with 
whistles; it may be, however, that the action could be arranged to 
start on the particular sound being produced by either side, if 
production by the enemy automatically means that he is aware of 
something being amiss, e.g. a shot from the sentry. 

Another consideration is that all members of the party for whom any 
signal is intended must be able to hear (or perhaps see) it, no 
matter how much noise or confusion there may be in the course of the 
action. 

Visual signals (by hand, arm, flag, etc.) are only dependable if the 
men for whom they are intended are looking towards the signaller at 








302 SOE SYLLABUS 


the time, and therefore a preceding audible signal may be necessary 
to attract their attention; subject to this limitation, however, 
visual signals are useful. 

In spite of the fact that signals of this type are overt, it is 
nevertheless desirable that the range at which they can be seen or 
heard should not be unnecessarily extended further than is essential 
for them to be noticed by the party; if this latter requirement is 
satisfied, the smaller radius at which they are obvious, the better. 

TYPE (b) . 

Signals falling into this category, "stealthy" signals, present much 
greater difficulties and require both forethought on the part of the 
leader and constant rehearsal by any of the party who may, in any 
eventuality, need to use them. 

They can be conveniently divided into two kinds: 

i) Those that are not sufficiently loud or visible to be heard or 
seen by the enemy. 

ii) Those which have to be received over some distance and therefore 
will be heard or seen by the enemy but must not make him 
suspicious. 

In considering (i), very careful thought must be given by the leader 
to the distances at which either audible or visible signals are 
likely to be perceptible by the members of the party under different 
weather conditions. For instance, a low hiss as a danger signal will 
be inadequate on a wet night with a high wind; likewise, in a ground 
mist, visual signals from a look-out who is giving warning of the 
approach of a convoy may be useless. 

It may be necessary for the leader to duplicate, audibly and 
visually, a certain signal under this heading, in order to cope with 
differing circumstances, e.g. the danger signal: it is quite likely 
that circumstances may arise when it is possible to make quite 
safely a movement of the band but not the slightest sound, and vice 
versa. 

It is not possible to specify as being superior to others any 
particular sound designed to reach the ears of the members of the 
party but not those of the enemy; a hiss, click of the tongue, or 
various air-noises in the mouth, etc., are all useful, according to 
circumstances and weather conditions. 

Recognition signals can never truly come into this category since 
their use necessarily implies either that the party is separated and 
endeavouring to rejoin, or that the user is not certain of the 
identity of the person to whom the signal is directed. 

In considering (ii) - these which have to carry over some distance 
and will therefore be heard or seen by the enemy, but which must not 
make him suspicious - it will iiranediately be clear that, in the 



SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 303 


majority of cases, they will be audible signals, and usually the 
only possibilities will be animal or bird sounds with some 
characteristic to distinguish them from the genuine sound: this 
characteristic may be some slight variation of note, usually at the 
end, or may be repetition in a prescribed order or with definite 
intervals. 

A sound will therefore be chosen that is: 

a) Probable in the particular locality, i.e. do not choose a hyena 
for use in Europe, or a cock crowing in the middle of the desert. 

b) Not likely to attract attention in itself, e.g. a dog barking is 
always a suspicious sound and may cause investigation by the 
enemy. 

c) Not too difficult to learn, and one of which the genuine version 
can be heard by the members of the party and rehearsed by those 
who will use it. 

Suitable sounds will therefore vary with the country and district in 
which the party is operating. Sounds for use by night must be 
confined to those animals and birds which are normally noisy be 
night, and the same applies to signals for use by day. 

Specimens are: 

By night: owl. By day: wood pigeon. 

Endless possible sounds could be listed and the above are quoted as 
examples only. 

GENERAL . 

Once an audible signal has been chosen which imitates a natural 
sound, it must be rehearsed until the leader is satisfied that all 
members of the party who may possibly need to use it are capable of 
producing the sound realistically whenever required, and that all 
the party can recognise it. He cannot be satisfied on this point 
unless he has listened carefully to the genuine sound for 
comparison. 

It is always better for signals conveying different meanings to be 
entirely different sounds and not merely diverse multiplications of 
the same sound: this avoids the possibility of a man hearing only 
part of a signal and acting accordingly, e.g. hearing two out of 
four blasts on a whistle and quite rightly carrying out some 
different action for which two blasts had been the prescribed 
signal. 

All signals should be kept as short and uncomplicated as is 
consistent with their being received and understood. 

The use of string or cord has been advocated by some people as a 
means of intercommunication and of keeping in touch within a small 



304 SOE SYLLABUS 


party moving in single file on dark nights. As a means of inter¬ 
communication it is not very satisfactory: the circumstances of its 
use imply that it will almost certainly be tugged and pulled at 
moments when no signal is intended, either through someone stumbling 
in the dark or through the cord itself being caught up in some 
obstruction, but as a means of keeping in touch it is quite good - 
the cord should have knots along its length corresponding with the 
number of men. Use can also be made of a cord as a previously laid 
guide-line in difficult going in darkness, e.g. through a thick wood 
or across a ford. In a previous lecture we recommended that every 
man should carry on an operation a length of at least four yards of 
stout string: by tying these together a suitable cord can be made 
for use as either a guide-line or a contact-line.

MINOR TACTICS 
APPENDIX I

RECCE OF &lt;?RQVNP &amp; SELECTION QF. RQVTS 

All Fieldcraft and Minor Tactics are a means to an end - their 
purpose is to enable you to reach your objective undetected, or to 
withdraw from it in safety. These lectures contain general 
considerations applying to all operations requiring stealth; the 
actual tactics of different types of operations are discussed in 
detail in other lectures. 

"Fieldcraft" has been defined as "the art of being like an animal in 
its own terrain" - which implies a complete familiarity with the 
ground over which one is working. Since we are often operating in 
country which is strange to us, the importance of recce is clear and 
cannot be over-estimated. 

If recce is to be of real value, there must be a clear idea what is 
to be looked for and what the recce may be expected to decide. 

Recce of the ground should always decide the following factors: 

1. The best route (both for advance and withdrawal). 

2. The best clothing and personal equipment. 

3. The amount of time necessary. 

4. The establishment of bounds and landmarks. 

5. The organization of all-round defence. 

These points may be considered in detail as follows: 

1. Ihe_fag£- prg a ff gct ing_^he_ghoice_. of . rout e: 

a) Enemy dispositions - guards, patrols, system of communication, 
wire, proximity of local troops, etc. 

b) Other, features ±o be aygi4ed. These include roads, paths, 
houses (particularly farms, where there are always dogs and 
other domestic animals to announce arrival), any place where 
there is any congregation of either wild or domestic animals 
or birds, and all skylines. If careful attention is paid to 
the latter on recce, it will very rarely be found necessary to 
cross a skyline. A place will almost always be found where 
there is a fold in the ground forming a "double skyline" (that 
is the skyline is not truly continuous, one part of it being 
behind the other), or where there is sufficient natural cover 
for the body never to appear in silhouette. 

c) The presence or absence of cover . The route chosen should 
afford the best cover during the latter stages of the approach 
when close to enemy. The most frequent mistake is that of 
choosing a route affording good initial cover, but little or 









306 SOE SYLLABUS 


none when it is most needed. In choosing the route, the aim 
should be that the party should be invisible from as many 
directions as possible for as long as possible, and that it 
should always be near enough to cover to be able to "melt 
away" if surprised. This implies that "broken" ground should 
be chosen, not open ground, and that the lowest part of that 
broken ground should be followed the whole time, even to a 
matter of inches. Always try to keep something between you and 
the enemy, even if it will only just hide you. 

d) The position of the sun . To approach by a route that will 

place you between the enemy and the sun, particularly when the 
sun is low in the morning or evening, is of great advantage. 

To have a sun low in your eyes as you approach is to be 
avoided at all costs. 

2. The best clothing and personal equipment ; 

a) Clothing . Certain general principles will always apply. The 
clothing should be of neutral colour and tone. Tone (that is, 
how light or how dark it is) is of more importance than 
colour. There must be no bright objects, such as buttons, belt 
buckles, etc., which may glint in the sun. No clothing should 
be worn which will make movement noisy even at the closest 
quarters, - i.e. leather may creak, metal objects may chink 
together, stiff material - such as a mackintosh - will rustle. 
Clothing should be looked over for loose buttons, etc., which 
might come off when crawling. Duplicate brace buttons are 
advisable - a man who is holding up his trousers with one hand 
is helpless. The distance and the type of ground to be covered 
will decide whether soft or hard shoes should be worn - boots 
are always clumsy and should be avoided when possible. Shoe 
covers (two pieces of sacking or other material to wrap round 
the feet) or a thick pair of socks which may be pulled on over 
the shoes and secured round the ankle, may be carried to 
facilitate silent movement on road or pavement or rock. Places 
on the route which might make the carrying of such special 
equipment necessary, should be looked for on the recce. The 
face and hands must be veiled or darkened, unless direct bluff 
is either contemplated or may be necessary in an emergency. 
This last consideration is fully discussed in the lecture 
"Appreciation". Methods of veiling and darkening the flesh are 
discussed in the next lecture on Minor Tactics. 

b) Personal equipment . Nothing must be carried which is 
unnecessary. Personal equipment must be cut down to a minimum, 
and unnecessary objects mean extra bulk, weight, noise and 
possible loss of security. The following are always useful, 
and should be carried independent of personal taste or the 
necessities of the particular operation decided by the recce. 

i) A knife, capable of being used either as a utility or 
offensive weapon. As an offensive weapon the ordinary 
clasp knife can be improved by sharpening the back of the 
blade for a short distance below the point. 







SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 307 


ii) A match-box, full, because a half-empty box rattles. If 
there are only a few matches in the box the lower part of 
the box should be filled out with grass or other 
material. 

iii) Some money - paper when possible - because coins in the 
pocket are noisy. 

iv) A length of at least four yards of stout string. This may 
be used for any purpose from tieing up a man to preparing 
a booby trap or stretching across a path to give warning 
of a man's approach. 

v) A watch, worn on the wrist, where it will not get crushed 
when crawling. 

vi) A compass, worn on a string round the neck, but carried down 
the back , where it will not cause discomfort when crawling, 

vii) Some first-aid equipment on the lines of the British 
First Field Dressing. 

The length of the operation and the type of ground will decide 
what type of quantity of food (or water) should be carried. 

3. T imi n g. 

In training, it will be found that the greatest number of 
operations fail due to inadequate attention being paid to timing. 
The greatest and most detailed attention should be paid to this 
on recce and the time taken to cover the ground on recce must be 
carefully noted. Whenever possible, the amount of time finally 
allowed for the operation should be greater than has appeared 
strictly necessary on recce. In open country the normal walking 
speed of a man is approximately 100 yards in one minute; nothing 
less than double this amount of time can be expected in an 
operation requiring stealth. Crawling may lengthen the time to as 
much as half-an-hour for the same distance, when really difficult 
ground has to be crossed, and all these things must be taken into 
consideration when finally computing the time necessary for the 
operation. During training it is useful to note constantly the 
amount of time taken to cross various pieces of ground, and to 
measure distances with the eye and compare them on the map. 

4. The establishment of bounds and landmarks . 

This is absolutely necessary on recce - failure to do so will 
frequently result in loss of direction when crossing difficult 
ground, and the failure of the operation. Two purposes are 
achieved by the establishment of bounds: 

a) Maintenance of direction. 

b) Ensuring observation of ground immediately to be crossed. 

The ground to be covered should be divided into sections, the end 
of each section or bound being a landmark easily recognisable 
from any direction. The necessity for this will be clear when it 
is remembered that it is not always approached from the expected 
direction, and that it is often impossible to raise the head 
above ground level when moving towards the objective, when each 




308 SOE SYLLABUS 


landmark is reached, the ground between it and the next should be 
thoroughly observed before it is crossed. Observation is fully 
dealt with in the next lecture. 

5. The organization of all-round defence . 

Nothing can ever obviate the necessity for all-round defence at 
all times. Danger does not always come from the expected direction 
and the advantage of surprise must lie with us and not with the 
enemy. When the force is composed of several men, each must be 
allotted an angle or direction for which he is responsible at all 
times . whether at halt or on the move, and his attention must 
never stray from this direction. When alone, a man must constantly 
be looking all round him all the time, never allowing himself to 
become preoccupied with one direction to the exclusion of others. 

Recce by field-glasses or telescope . When recce is conducted by 
field-glasses or telescope, the following points should be 
remembered: 

a) "Dead" ground is not easily distinguishable, i.e. glasses have 
the effect of flattening out ground. 

b) Distances between objects in line ahead appear smaller than 
they really are. 

c) Distances between objects in line abreast appear greater than 
they really are. 

d) In bright weather, flash may be produced by the object glass 
which will give away the position of the observer unless a 
shield or shade is used. Such a shade should not be less than 
15 cms. long for an object glass of 50 mms. or 10 cms. long 
for an object glass of 30 mms. The shade may be made of brown 
paper or cardboard, or other material available. When nothing 
else is available, the hands may be cupped to form an 
extension or funnel to each object glass. 

e) The ground to be searched should be divided into sections, and 
each section searched from flank to flank. Each travel of the 
glass should overlap the previous one. 

f) A greater degree of steadiness can be obtained by pressing the 
eyepieces against the upper part of the eye-socket and resting 
the elbows, thus forming a wedge. 

In all cases where the leader of a party is unable to carry out a 
personal recce, he should arrange for a written Route Report, 
with sketches or sketch-maps of the ground. This is fully dealt 
with in the lecture on Route Reports. 

(At the end of the lecture, the Instructor should repeat the five 
points to which particular attention should be paid on recce.)

MINOR TACTICS 
APPENDIX II 

January 1944 


GENERAL MOVEMENT BY DAY 


1. Formations . 

Any party of men moving across country should move in a definite 
formation, not in a constantly changing huddle or a straggling 
line. The reasons for this, and the essentials of any formation, 
are to ensure: 

a) Maximum use of available cover. 

b) Permanent all-round defence. 

c) Adequate communication between all members of the party, but 
particularly between the leader and his scouts. 

A great many formations have been devised for use by the regular 
army, some of which fulfil these requirements, but most are 
unsatisfactory because they are impossible to maintain, either 
for a long distance or in broken country, and very few really 
ensure the maximum use of available cover. Chiefly for this 
latter reason we do not use the diamond and box shaped 
formations. 

For a small body of men moving across any type of country, there 
is no better formation than single file with scouts ahead. 

In speaking of formations we have in mind here a basic sized 
party of 10 men but the formation applies equally well to larger 
or smaller parties. When, however, a party of 20 or more men are 
concerned it is better in any case to form into two parties and 
rendezvous, as for any stealthy operation a party of such a size 
is unwieldy. 

This formation complies with the three requirements mentioned - 
particularly it ensures that the whole of the main body use the 
cover chosen by the leader, which is extremely difficult to 
ensure in an extended formation. Only the scouts use high ground, 
and that only enough to ensure the safety of the party they are 
preceding. In a box or diamond formation, on the other hand, the 
flank men must constantly be using ground where there is no 
cover, in order to maintain their position in the formation. 

The intervals between the members of the party, and between the 
scouts and the leader, depend entirely on the nature of the 
ground and the limit of visibility. The scouts must be in touch 
with the leader and in touch with each other - once they are out 
of sight of the leader they are useless . Under the best 
visibility conditions it is not desirable for them to be more 
than 100-150 metres in front of the leader, but in darkness or in 
very close country, only contact with the leader can decide the 
maximum distance. The leader must watch his scouts the whole time 








310 SOE SYLLABUS 


for any signal they may give him - they are his eyes. 

The only time when a considerable interval between members of the 
main party is desirable is when, for instance, an open hillside 
must be crossed in distant view of the enemy. Here, a close mass 
of men moving would be visible when widely separated men would 
not. Each man of the party is responsible for observing in a 
particular direction the whole time, and he must be able to draw 
the leader's attention to anything that he sees with the least 
possible delay - a wide interval between members of the party 
makes this difficult. 

When the party halts it is automatically covered by the scouts, 
to ensure that it is not taken by surprise. This should be an 
invariable rule, whatever the reason for the halt. 

Also, whatever the reason for the halt, the whole of the main 
party must immediately get into cover. The practice of halting 
for discussion in exposed places is very common in training and 
is a very serious fault. As soon as the leader realises that a 
halt is necessary, whether because he is off his route and must 
use the map or because he has reached the end of a bound and must 
wait for the scouts to observe, he must immediately get his party 
into a position where they cannot be seen. This is all the more 
important if the halt is in order to study the map - the white 
flash of a map can be seen at a great distance and at no time 
should more of it be exposed than is absolutely necessary. 

2. u s e Of ba ck ground . 

Where there is no cover, background can be effectively used, 
provided that the following points are remembered: 

a) In any ordinary neutral-tinted clothing a man at a distance 
looks darker than his background. This can easily be 
demonstrated by watching a man cross a hillside which is 
partly light and partly dark coloured. Therefore, always keep 
as dark a background as you can. 

b) The colour of the face and the hands is unnatural to any 
landscape and by their position on the figure easily define 
the object as a human being. They should, therefore, always be 
blacked or veiled. It is not enough to black the face only, as 
is so often done - the hands must be darkened also. Any 
mixture used for blacking should not contain oil unless in the 
smallest quantities, to make it adhesive - a oily surface 
shines and catches the light. Veils have the advantage that 
they can quickly be discarded if there is any chance of 
passing as a friend. The best material for veils is fine mesh 
black or green muslin net, and it should be soaked in hot 
water for some hours to remove its starchiness. If this is not 
done it will make a constant rustling noise round the head, 
which makes hearing difficult. The veil should be of double 
thickness over the whole face except for a belt of single 
thickness running round the front from ear to ear. It is not 



SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 311 


sufficient to leave eyeholes of single thickness as it will be 
found that vision is very much restricted at the sides. The 
veil must be made to tie on securely or it will be easily 
displaced when crawling or passing through thick cover. 

c) Any swiftly moving object is very easily seen - movements 
should be slow and smooth. 

d) Shadows flatter the resemblance between you and your 
background - keep to the shadows wherever possible. 

3. Crawling technique . 

When both cover and background fail, it is necessary to crawl. 

Crawling is usually performed in a very haphazard way due to a 

lack of clear understanding of what the crawler is trying to 

achieve. 

The primary consideration is whether you are crawling to: 

a) avoid being seen; 

b) avoid being heard; 

c) avoid both. 

Each requires a different technique and unless this is clearly 

understood the result can never be satisfactory. 

a) When crawling to avoid being seen, the whole body should be as 
close as possible to the ground. Since there can be no head 
without a body following it, and no rump without a head 
preceding it, it is quite useless to keep one part of the body 
low unless the rest of the body follows suit - the strength of 
the chain is the strength of its weakest link. Every part of 
the body, including the face, must touch the ground. Movement 
is effected by fingers and toes (left and right alternately, 
not together) the arms being stretched out immediately in 
front of the body. This is commonly called the "flat" or 
"snake" crawl. 

b) When crawling to avoid being heard, the "bear" crawl should be 
used. It is so called because a bear leaves one set of 
footprints only, like a biped, the hind feet being placed 
exactly in the imprint of the fore. In the case of the man, 
the knees are placed in the exact positions of the hands, 
which have first carefully felt for and removed any noisy 
material on the ground. 


c) When crawling to avoid both being seen and heard, a compromise 
technique is required. The fingers of both hands are 
interlocked under the chest, and at each forward movement the 
body is lifted just clear of the ground, assisted by the toes 
of both feet moved together. As in position (a), the head is 
kept as close to the ground as possible and the body is lifted 
no higher than to allow its clear passage without a dragging 
sound. 



312 SOE SYLLABUS 


The smaller the surface area the body presents to the enemy, the 
less likely it will be to be detected - therefore when crawling 
always face the enemy if possible. 

4. Observation . 

Observation is necessary at the end of each bound, to ensure the 
safety of the ground which the party is about to cross, it is 
necessary when approaching the objective and it is necessary on 
recce. Never spend less than three minutes in observation - a 
quick glance is useless and merely lulls into a sense of what may 
be false security. The thing to look for first is movement 
because it is most easily seen. Then look carefully at anything 
that is darker than its surroundings; lastly at anything that is 
much lighter than its surroundings. If you are suspicious of an 
object - take no chances; wait until your mind is made up. 

If there is more than one in the party, the observer's rear 
should be covered by another member of the party. His attention 
is fully occupied with the direction in which he is observing and 
he is vulnerable to attack from behind. The aim of observation is 
to see without being seen, and, if this can be achieved, the 
greatest possible advantage has been secured over the enemy. 

Since the most prominent feature will be the head, the importance 
pf its cam pu_fJ^age_Qr_di^s_gui L se_cannoJ ; _ be over-es tim a ted. The head 
can be camouflaged either by natural or artificial means but it 
must be done thoroughly. Two blades of grass do not make you 
invisible, nor is it enough merely to cover the head if the 
outline of its shape still remains. If natural camouflage is used 
(i.e. herbage, etc.) it should be used plentifully, so that no 
part of the headgear remains uncovered and the head can be 
exposed down to the level of the eyes without fear of 
recognition. It should be remembered that natural herbage dies 
quickly and, especially in cases of plants which have very light- 
coloured under-sides to the leaves, may be very visible when 
dead. The simplest of all means of natural camouflage of the head 
is a sheet of moss and has two great advantages. First, it is to 
be found everywhere in the world where there are trees or rocks; 
second, it requires no making or work as it can be taken off the 
ground in a solid piece that will cover the whole head - a ready 
made hat. Artificial camouflage of the head is a hat that is 
constructed to look like something else, and is dependent upon 
personal ingenuity. It is rarely as satisfactory as natural 
camouflage. 

When possible, observations should be done round . not over, 
cover, and at around level . The human eye is unconsciously most 
receptive of movement at is own level above the ground, and 
movement much higher or much lower than this level (i.e. in trees 
or at ground level) is frequently overlooked. The head, then, 
should be kept as close as possible to the ground when observing 
round an object, and only just enough of it exposed to allow 
observation - it is quite unnecessary to expose the whole head. 

If the head is not camouflaged, the part of it that is exposed 
should be protected by a bunch of herbage held before it. 








SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 313 


Any object of regular outline should be avoided as a place from 
which to observe - anything protruding from a smooth surface is 
very easily seen, (instance British and German trench parapets 
1914-16). 

The greatest of all aids to observation is a periscope, which 
allows the observer to see without exposing himself at all. 
Periscopes are not generally obtainable, but a rough one is not 
difficult to make. Thousands of these were home-made for the 
coronation of the present King - consisting of a simple 
arrangement of mirrors on a stick. (Demonstrate model). 

The movement of the head during observation must be extremely 
slow - the head must be raised inch by inch and lowered again in 
the same way - any quick or jerky movement attracts attention at 
once. 

5. Animals and Birds . 

In addition to the possibility of your own movements being 
detected by sound or sight, the likelihood of deduction of your 
whereabouts from disturbed animals or birds must not be 
overlooked. This applies to disturbance of both domestic and wild 
animals and birds. Sheep when alarmed run and huddle together, 
staring in the direction of the object that has frightened them; 
domestic geese set up a great noise and walk in the direction of 
the intruder - to cite two examples only. Wild animals and birds, 
being more generally distributed and more difficult to avoid, 
present a great problem. Rooks at a rookery will set up a great 
commotion and rise high over the trees when their territory is 
invaded; wood pigeons fly out of the trees with a clapping of 
wings. Magpies, jays, jackdaws, etc., all have their own 
unmistakable alarm notes. In arable land the movement of game¬ 
birds will often locate the position of a man accurately. Hares, 
which have a preference for crossing open ground when disturbed, 
also betray the position. A piece of rabbit-infested ground 
without a rabbit to be seen means that someone has passed that 
way recently. Instances can be multiplied beyond the scope of a 
lecture. Many dangers of this sort are difficult to avoid, but 
ground where there are known to be definite congregations of 
animals or birds, i.e. sheep-ground, rookeries, rabbit warrens, 
etc. should be avoided in the choice of a route. 

Remember that these things will not betray you only, they will 
also betray the enemy if you pay attention to them. An obviously 
alarmed animal or bird should always make you suspicious until 
you know the cause of it. 

There is also much to be deducted from the ground. A man will not 
always leave footprints, but except on the hardest ground he will 
always leave some mark of his passage - the grasses are bent, a 
rock is marked where a nailed boot has scratched it, some moss is 
rubbed from it, a wisp of wool is left on barbed wire; but these 
things will not be noticed unless they are looked for. The 
subject of human footprints is too specialised a subject to go 



314 SOE SYLLABUS 


into in detail, but some points are worth remembering. 

6. Footprints . 

a) General . A small amount of loose soil is always thrown up by 
the heel and the toe, forward in the first case, backward in 
the latter. The amount of soil is in direct relation to the 
speed of travel. The most marked impression is left by the 
outside of the back of the heel and the inside of the toe. The 
faster the travel, also, the closer laterally the right and 
left foot, and the straighter the feet are pointing. 

b) Walking . Average pace slightly over 30". If a small man taking 
long steps, heel indentation is deeper. Carrying a heavy load 
feet are wider apart laterally, toes pointed more outward, 
steps short, indentation deep especially at toe and outside 
edge of foot. A stout man leaves a similar track, but less 
indented at the toes, the track more regular with less 
divergence. The height of a man is usually about six and one- 
third times the length of the imprint of his naked feet. A 
lame man takes a short step with his lame leg, not his sound 
one. 

c) Running. 

i) Trained runner : Indentation of toe deep, possibly no heel 
mark. Distance between paces up too 6 ft. for a 6ft. man. 
Prints in straight line, no outward turn of toes, 
ii) Untrained runner : Heel print deep as well as toe print, 
heel pointed less straight, noticeable divergence in 
straight line of track. The same track will be shown by 
any man running under stress of great emotion or mental 
confusion. 

d) Freshness of tracks . In very fresh tracks the loose earth 
thrown up will look darker than the surrounding earth, edges 
of print sharp, not rounded by rain or wind. Broken vegetation 
will not have begun to wither at the break, which becomes 
noticeable after a few hours, varying with the weather. Bent 
grasses will not have recovered upright position. Age of 
tracks may be known from effect of rain showers when these 
have been recent. Best practice of all is look at your own 
footprints at varying times after you have made them and in 
varying weather conditions. 

e) Tire Tracks . Most important consideration is which way they 
are going. Most certain way is by crossing or overlapping of 
front wheel tracks by rear wheels. Over a bump tracks will 
momentarily broaden out at the far side, as the tire takes the 
downward bump of the chassis. Position of the tracks on the 
road are also an indication, especially when cornering. In the 
case of a bicycle, direction is more easily distinguishable, 
as rear wheel more often crosses or obscures front wheel, 
especially uphill as the forward position of the rider causes 
more wobble. The faster the travel the straighter the line. 










SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 315 


. Summary . 

There can be no passengers in a party. Every man has a job to do 
all the tine, and unless at a halt for rest, he must never relax. 
If training is to be useful, this idea must be applied throughout 
it. The slackness of one man can ruin the value of a training 
scheme for a whole party. Training here is intensive, and time on 
schemes cannot be wasted.

GENERAL MOVEMENT BY NIGHT 

Much of the Lecture II (Movement by Day) applies also to Movement by 
Night, but because at night our primary aim is SILENCE, there will 
be certain differences, but not as far as formation goes. 

We recommend the Single File formation for use in all light conditions. 
At night this formation will, however, be closed up to whatever degree 
may be necessary to ensure control of his party by the leader. 

The differences will particularly affect the route - the type of 
ground over which we want to move. 

1. Fa cto r? i nf lu e ncin g th e c hoice Qf ro ut e. 

a) g.e.a.t_tyBe_Q.f_CQ.yer• 

As in day work, the route should give the best cover in the 
latter stages of the approach, but a different type of cover 
will be required. SILENCE is the keynote - therefore the 
thickest cover will very rarely be the best. Ground that is 
silent to move over, will then be the first consideration. On 
a very dark night nothing else need be thought of. If it is a 
little lighter, ke.ep._a _dgr. k _b ac .kgr. p u nd . If it is a very bright 
moonlight night the considerations will be the same as for day 
operations. If there is a likelihood of searchlights or Verey 
lights being used, keep close to cover that you can get behind 
quickly. Remember that the direct route is a bad one nine 
times out of ten. 

b) Features to be avoided . 

Particularly these will be any features that may give you away 
through noise . Any farmyard, and place where domestic animals 
are confined, is a death trap. Where there are known to be 
dogs, the direction of the wind must be remembered too. Ground 
that is noisy to move over must be noted on recce and avoided 
on operation. Avoid all skylines and water - they are of equal 
importance. It is less easy to tell when one is silhouetted at 
night than in daylight, but you are even more obvious to the 
enemy. A party moving along the side of a piece of water is 
bound to be silhouetted from some angle - this applies even 
more to the sea. Avoid the most obvious route or approach - 
this is where the defence will be strongest. 

c) The Moon . 

Always find out the times of its rising and setting, and do 
not rely upon visibility being good while the moon is up. 
Remember that the slightest change in light conditions at

night has a much greater affect on seeing than in daylight, 
and that they can change very quickly. Approach by a route 
that gets the moon behind the enemy - just the reverse of the 
route you would choose with the sun in daylight. 

2. Clothing for Niaht Work . 

The colour of the clothing is not important if the tone (that is, 
how light or how dark it is) is neutral. Very dark clothes are 
bad - when you see a man at night it is because he is even 
blacker than his surroundings. Wear nothing that is very dark or 
very light. Any form of shininess must be avoided, and things 
that will shine when they are wet. There must be nothing that 
will be noisy in movement - no squeaking shoes, creaking leather 
braces, etc. Mackintosh material is bad because it rustles when 
moved. Rubber or rope-soled shoes are the best - when this is not 
possible, carry shoe cover as described in the last lecture. The 
face and hands must be darkened or veiled. Even on a very dark 
night, when this would seem unimportant, there is the danger of a 
sudden light. Unless the face and hands are darkened this will 
show you up at once. 

3. Personal Equipment . 

In addition to the personal equipment mentioned for day work, the 
following should be carried: 

a) A stick. This enables the ground to be felt carefully before 
you, which is very necessary on a really dark night. This must 
not have a metal ferrule, which is noisy. If an old bicycle 
tube is available, the whole stick can be encased in it and 
tightly bound. This prevents sharp noise when the stick knocks 
against anything. The stick may also have a lead-loaded head 
as a weapon of silent offence. 

b) A small pocket torch and one spare battery. The torch can be 
encased in a section of bicycle tube in the same way, to avoid 
jingling against other objects in the pockets, or it can be 
bound with rags. A home-made arrangement on the glass, so that 
the aperture can be varied from a pin-point to the whole area 
of the glass, is advisable. 

c) Watch and compass with luminous dials. The watch is best worn 
on the wrist, with face against the skin instead of outwards. 
The compass in the way recommended for day work. 

d) Some cough lozenges or sweets to suck. This prevents coughing. 

Again, as in day work, nothing must be carried which is 
unnecessary. Care must be taken that there are no noisy objects 
in the pockets and it is the duty of the leader of a party to 
make sure of this himself. Jump up and down on the floor and see 
if there is any other noise than that of your feet.

4. Timing and Communication . 

Accurate timing is the only substitute for direct communication, 
which is exceedingly difficult by night. A very careful estimate 
of the amount of time necessary to cover each piece of ground 
should be made. When moving silently in favourable country the 
index figure of 50 yards in one minute is a useful one to 
remember. But however accurate the timing, signals remain 
absolutely necessary, and must be arranged, practised and 
rehearsed before any scheme or operation. The essentials of a 
signal for use at night are that it should be sufficiently loud 
to be certain of being heard, and that it should not sound like a 
human being. The signal of a dog barking, most often used by 
students, is not good, because a dog barking is in itself a 
suspicious thing. When an animal signal is used there must be 
some way of distinguishing it from the genuine animal - i.e. it 
must finish in a particular way or be given in a certain rhythm. 
The sounds usually made are so unrealistic that this is not 
necessary, but that is not our aim. There must be a signal for 
danger, a signal for dispersal, a signal for simple recognition 
and a signal for halting. 

5. All-round Defence at Night . 

The same principle applies as in day work. Each man in the party 
must have a permanent responsibility for an angle or direction. 
But the whole party may easily blunder into danger if one golden 
rule is not followed - STOP FREQUENTLY AND LISTEN. Again and 
again in training, students blunder right into enemy which they 
should have detected had they followed this one simple rule. It 
is the only way to ensure that the ground in front of you is 
safe, and its importance cannot be stressed too much. During 
these halts for listening, each man keeps his attention on the 
direction for which he is personally responsible. To make this 
system work well, the whole party must be closed up well, so that 
no man is far separated from the the rest of the party. On a dark 
night, even the scouts will be separated from the leader by no 
more than a pace or two, and the main party will be close enough 
together to touch one another. If the operation is a long one, 
and the party halts for rest and sleep, they must be covered by a 
proper covering party the whole time. There should be two awake 
for every one asleep, so that a fight can be put up even if the 
covering party itself is taken by surprise. 

6. Use of Field-glasses at Niaht . 

Good use can be made of field glasses at night if they are of a 
sufficiently high "light equivalent". The "light equivalent" is 
arrived at by dividing the number of magnifications into the 
measurement of the object glass in mm and squaring the result. 

The number of magnifications is given first on all glasses, the 
measurement of the object glass second, i.e. 8 x 30 or 10 x 50. 
The "light equivalent" of the first would be 14 (to the nearest 
decimal); that of the second would be 25. A "light equivalent" of 
about 10 is necessary for use at night. 





SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 319 


7. The Technique of Individual Movement . 

When ordinarily walking in the daytime, one is, without being 
conscious of it, constantly stepping over small obstacles, 
lifting the feet where there is a step up, and so on. It is 
impossible to do this at night because it is impossible to see 
the ground in front of one's feet. Therefore the only way to 
avoid constantly tripping over small objects is to lift the feet 
much higher from the ground than one does in daytime - almost a 
mark time action - and shorten the steps accordingly. This also 
avoids the noise made by the feet brushing through long grass or 
other herbage, and is the basis of all silent movement in the 
dark. Carelessness is at the root of all noisy movement, and it 
is impossible to be careful when moving fast, so all movement 
should be slow. The full weight should not be placed upon the 
foot until it has been tested lightly - this does not take much 
time and avoids breaking large sticks, stepping in large holes 
and so on. The foot should be pointed straight - the "Charlie 
Chaplin Walk" presents a larger area of frontal surface and is 
noisy. 

The rubber-cased stick, mentioned under "Equipment", will be 
found of great assistance in moving across rough ground. 

If there is noisy ground to cross, wait for a "counter noise" - 
some car, train, a gust of wind - anything that will cover the 
noise you make. 

Rec.Qan it ign_ p f_noi§y_an.4_§i l e nt _ground. 

The following rule is not invariable but it is very nearly always 
true except of artificial surfaces. Noisy ground looks dark- 
coloured, silent ground looks light-coloured. This is due to the 
fact that the dark colour is almost always due to a number of 
small shadows and means that there are small objects like sticks, 
herbage, stones, etc. on the ground. Where there are no shadows 
the ground must be smooth, and therefore silent. 

8. The Best Use of the Senses at Night . 

It is important that the best use should be made of what remains 
of sight. The degree to which men can see in the dark varies 
greatly. It should be the job of a leader to find out the degree 
of night sight which each of his men possesses and use them 
accordingly. Certain foods do improve sight at night, but only 
over too long a period to be much use. There are, however, 
certain things to be avoided, and alcohol is the most important. 
It should never be drunk the day preceding a night operation. 

A man's normal powers of sight are not recovered fully for at least 
half-an-hour after coming out of artificial light into the dark. 

Staring at an object for too long is to be avoided. If you stare 
at an object that you cannot see plainly, the eyes begin to play 
tricks - the edges blur and there seems to be movement where 
there is none. Many a shot has been fired and position given away 







320 SOE SYLLABUS 


for this reason. If you are suspicious of an object, concentrate 
on listening, giving it a rapid glance at intervals. By this 
means any change in its shape or position is much more easily 
detected. It is sometimes easier to see an object if you do not 
look straight at it but a few degrees off it. 

Any bright light, such as a flare, searchlight, etc., will rob 
you of your sight for some minutes. Therefore, close your eyes 
when there is a likelihood of being dazzled. The moment after 
such light is extinguished is useful for any quick movement, 
while the enemy is partially blinded. Remember that at night or 
in a mist, small objects nearby are apt to look like much larger 
objects further away. For example, a bunch of thistles seen from 
ground level ten yards away may look like a big bush or tree a 
hundred or more yards away. 

He ar i n g a t Night . 

This, more than any other sense, must be relied on to replace 
sight, and the aim should be to achieve the acute analytical 
hearing of a blind man. This can only be done by constant and 
conscientious practice, trying to analyse sounds in the dark, and 
obtain a clear mental picture of what is going on without any use 
of sight. It can be practised by closing the eyes in the daytime, 
and trying to understand what is going on round about you as a 
blind man does. Human ears are badly placed for hearing. Animals 
may be roughly divided into animals that pursue and animals that 
are pursued, and each of these main groups have their ears placed 
in the way most suited to their needs. Thus a hare or rabbit is 
able to turn its ears almost completely to the rear, a fox or 
wolf almost completely forward. Thus by facing the direction of 
the sound, a human being is not getting the best use from either 
ear - one ear only should be turned in that direction. 

Hearing is the most acute when the mouth is slightly open - and 
when not trying to see at the same time, each sense being at its 
best when operating alone. 

A loud explosion has the same effect on the hearing as a flare or 
other bright light has upon the sight. The deafening effect is 
greatly magnified when the teeth are clenched, which is the 
comman reaction, because of the greater vibration thus produced. 
The mouth should be slightly open, and should the explosion be 
expected it is always best to cover the ears. In the same way 
that the moment after a dazzling light has subsided is a good 
moment for moving (because the enemy is blinded) the moment after 
an explosion is a good one for noisy movement that has to be 
made, because the enemy is deafened. 

Sound travels much more slowly than sight. The speed is 360 yards 
per second, but varies according to temperature and altitude. It 
is quicker in summer than in winter, quicker at low altitudes 
than high. The quickness of your movements must compensate for 
this time-lag, i.e. if you hear a round being slipped into the 
breach of a rifle, it may be half-way to the man's shoulder by 
the time the sound reaches you. 



SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 321 


Sound travels more clearly on a gentle wind than on a gale or 
when there is no wind at all. Fog also helps sound, rain deadens 
it. Fog has rather the same effect on sounds as it does on sight 
- a faint noise close by sounding like a louder one further away. 

Some substances are powerful sound conductors, in the same way 
that some cure electricity conductors. Still water and wood are 
two of the most dangerous. 

Touch . 

It is important that the sense of touch should be constantly 
practised, both in order to be able to obtain a mental picture of 
ground and objects by touch alone, and also to acquire dexterity 
which does not depend upon eyesight. When preparing a demolition, 
for instance, it is impossible to show the smallest light - the 
whole job must be done by the sense of touch alone. Unless it is 
constantly practised the handling of objects by touch alone will 
be clumsy and noisy, which spells certain failure.

MINOR TACTICS 
APPENDIX IV 
January 1944. 


CROSSING OF OBSTACLES 

The route chosen for the approach to any objective should obviously 
as far as possible avoid all obstacles - by which term we mean 
fences, hedges, roads, rivers, walls, etc. - in fact any natural 
feature which will either slow up movement or, as in the case of 
roads, constitute a danger point on the route. But there will always 
be obstacles to be crossed on almost any route to a worthwhile 
objective, and although these vary so greatly that no law can be 
laid down for the treatment of each, certain general principles will 
always apply. 

1. Brepari n a ob s ta cle s _foc- gro s sin g- 

Owing to the importance of absolute silence, whenever possible 
obstacles should be prepared for crossing during the 
reconnaissance of the route. That is to say, if there is a gap to 
be made in a hedge, an easy place to be found at which to get 
over a wall or to ford a stream, this must be done beforehand and 
MARKED in some way to make it easily recognisable at night. How 
clearly it can be marked must, of course, depend on the risks of 
the enemy noticing it. If it is not possible to do any 
preparation on recce owing to lack of time or nearness of the 
place to enemy posts, there is one invariable rule - one or, if 
necessary, two men should on the actual operation prepare the 
obstacle for crossing whilst the others cover. A disorganised 
rabble passing through a hedge or fording a stream by different 
routes is as great an advertisement as a brass band. 

Finally, a previously prepared obstacle must be approached with 
as much caution as a rendezvous, as it is always possible that 
the enemy may have found it. 

2. Method of crossing var io u s o bstacles - 

a) wi re Fences- 

Contact with stretched wire causes a vibration audible at a 
great distance in the direction in which the wire runs, and 
detectable by touch at an even greater distance. Any contact 
with the wire must therefore be avoided . When visibility is no 
consideration, the fence may be vaulted by placing the hand on 
the post or staple only, or it may be possible to crawl 
underneath the lowest strand if there is a likelihood of being 
seen. Reconnaissance should always establish the best point at 
which to cross an obstacle and, if possible, preparation of 
the obstacle should be done at the same time - i.e. removal of 
a wire strand in an inconspicuous way, or the scooping of a 
depression in the ground so that it is possible to crawl under 
the lowest strand. 









SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 323 


When it is necessary to cross a thick hedge, a hole through 
which to pass must be prepared either at the time or on the 
recce. When this is done on the actual operation, one man only 
must prepare the hole, while the others, if any, wait under 

cover until it is complete . 

c) Roads . 

There are several possible methods of crossing roads and in 
the case of a party it must be understood by everyone 
beforehand which method is to be used. The factors affecting 
the choice of method and of the point at which to cross are 
quite different for light and darkness. Visibility is the main 
consideration in daylight or bright moonlight; silence in 
darkness. 

Poi nts at which to cross . 

In daylight or bright moonlight, ideal points to cross would 
be either through a culvert or drain under the road, provided 
there is cover on either side, or on a bend with thickly 
covered rising ground on either side of the road. In the 
latter case, if the size of the party allowed it, a man would 
be sent to watch the road from each skyline while the main 
party crossed, rejoining them at a prearranged signal. At 
night, a culvert is, of course, an excellent point. On a 
country road another good point is where two hedges cut the 
road at right angles to it - these will form a good background 
both for the approach and movement away from the road, but the 
main consideration will be silence unless visibility is good. 

Method of Crossing . 

The main question, if no culvert or drain is available, is 
whether the road should be crossed by the party in one body or 
whether only one man should cross at a time. This must mainly 
be decided by the likelihood of surprise by the enemy. There 
are points for and against each method and it is up to the 
leader to decide which is the more suitable method in the 
particular circumstances. 

Cr ossing in one body - facto r? f or ; 

i) No waste of time. 

ii) A shorter time during which there is anything for the 
enemy to see. 

- factors against: 


i) A large bunch of men is more easy to see and more likely 
to catch the eye. 

ii) If the road is ambushed or covered by fire, the whole 

party can be destroyed by one burst of fire. All the eggs 
are in one basket. 









324 SOE SYLLABUS 


The reverse of these circumstances is true for the other 
method. 

If only one man crosses the road at a time, an internal must 
be decided by the leader. 10 seconds is the interval most 
commonly used. The party will not move off until the last man 
has crossed. It sometimes happens that there is no very 
suitable spot for crossing a road, and that this must be done 
within actual view of the enemy, though probably at a 
considerable distance. It must then be decided whether it is 
better to: 

i) Crawl across the road and rely upon extreme slowness of 
the movement to escape detection. This would be possible 
when a) the road was narrow and traffic infrequent; b) in 
failing light. 

ii) Wait for something to happen which will momentarily 

distract the enemy's attention and then cross the road 
rapidly in one body. 

The choice of a method can only be decided by conditions at the 
time - i.e. light conditions, traffic, whether heavy rain, etc. 

d) Walls . 

Here there is the skyline danger and sitting or standing on 
the wall must be avoided. For ordinary walls, either - 

i) Throw one leg across, lie on top of the wall flat and 
roll over, keeping as low as possible, 
ii) "Dive" on to wall and roll over. 

For high walls, some method as taught in P.T. must be used, or 
a ladder or rope with a grapnel. 

Other Methods : 

Use creepers, overhanging trees, fruit tree wires, staples, 
crevices, or make a pile of logs or boxes until the hands can 
reach top. Other things: Improvised ladder, old gates, doors, 
garden seats, trellis work, old bedsteads. 

The best thing of all to do is to avoid high walls whenever 
possible. 

e) water. 

i) Rivers . 

When the stream is deep and slow moving try to find a 
ford. A good point to cross is at a bend - there is often 
a gravel bottom and firm ground on both banks. Also it is 
more difficult for people to see you. 

Use driftwood or floating vegetation to camouflage the 
head. If you swim, try to land amongst rushes or beneath 
overhanging trees. But ensure that the bank is not too 
steep to climb. 






SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 325 


ii) For swiftly flowing streams, cross in shallows where the 
water flows over pebbles, i.e. a small rapid but never 
above a fall. Avoid large boulders and never jump on to 
rocks over which water is flowing. A rope is a great 
advantage and a sound safety precaution. If you swim, 
start higher up than the point at which you aim to land 
and swim diagonally across, allowing the current to carry 
you down. 

f) Barbed wire . 

i) Double Apron Type - 

- Cut lower strands with wire cutters and crawl through. 
If alone cut near pickets and hold long strands in 
other hand. If there are two of you one man grasps 
wire and the other cuts between his hands - cut close 
to pickets to avoid noise. 

- It is sometimes possible to climb carefully through 
the wire, but avoid touching upper wire with pack or 
clothing. 

- Throw coat or sacking across, or wire netting and 
climb over. 

- One man to lie across while others crawl over him. 

ii) Dannert Wire - by careful manipulation it is possible to 
crawl through by separating the coils. 

iii) If it is not necessary to be silent, any of the methods 
of vaulting wire as taught in P.T. will do. 

iv) Beware of the possibility of fence being electrified - 
look for insulators on pickets.

HOW MUCH TQ USE 


H.2. 

November, 1943. 


1. GENERAL REMARKS . 

a) Number of charges . - In all demolition work the number of 
charges should be kept to the minimum compatible with economy 
of explosive and the attainment of the desired effect. 

"THE DEMOLITION MUST NEVER FAIL." 

b) Degree of accuracy required. - It is not necessary for the 
charge required to effect a given demolition to be calculated 
with greater accuracy than to the NEAREST POUND, or in the 
case of mined charges 25 LBS. (i.e. one tin of Ammonal). While 
waste of explosive should never be countenanced, especially as 
supply must necessarily be limited, nevertheless the risk of 
failure to carry out a complete demolition in order to save 
small quantities of explosive is NEVER JUSTIFIABLE. A small 
margin of safety must therefore be left, even under ideal 
conditions, since small irregularities may easily occur in the 
strength of explosives or the security of fixing. 

"THE DEMOLITION MUST NEVER FAIL." 

Conditions will sometimes arise in the field for which no 
allowance is made in the following formulae. In such cases a too 
rigid adherence to these formulae must be avoided, they should be 
taken more as a guide than as a hard and fast rule. When in 
doubt, err on the side of overestimating the charge required. 

"THE DEMOLITION MUST NEVER FAIL." 

2. FIXATIONCHARGES. 

Charges may be divided into three main classes, the 
characteristics of which are discussed below. There is no marked 
line of division between these classes, and compromise between 
them will often occur in practice. 

a) Cutting Charges . - The explosive is place superficially, and 
acts chiefly through shattering action at the instant of 
detonation. Hard substances are very susceptible to the sudden 
blow produced on detonation; thus for steel work and similar 
hard materials this class of charge should invariably be used. 
In the case of masonry, however, the amount of explosive 
required soon sets a limit on the thickness which it is 
economical to attack with cutting charges, and compels the use 
of other methods. 

b) Mined or Buried Charges . - The explosive is placed 
underground, and acts through lifting and pushing action due 











336 SOE SYLLABUS 


to the expansion of the gases formed on detonation. Explosive 
is most efficiently employed in this manner, since its full 
effect is developed. 

c) Concussion Charges . - These are a modified form of mined charge, 
in which an enclosed air space replaces solid tamping, and the 
lifting action of the explosive takes effect through the 
pressure of displaced air ("blast") on the containing walls. 

3. APPLICATION OF CHARGES . 

a) Steel a nd Ir on . - Can only be cut with a cutting charge; 
though girders may be greatly damaged by the twisting caused 
when their abutments are demolished by mined charges. 

b) Masonry . - A thickness of not more than 5 or 6 feet may be 
attacked with a cutting charge. When this thickness is 
exceeded, the employment of a cutting charge becomes 
uneconomical and unreliable. Masonry is normally attacked by 
the use of "borehole" charges. This, however, necessitates the 
use of special tools, and must suffer from the amount of time 
and labour required. 

c) Timber . - Owing to its tough and fibrous nature, timber 
requires an even larger cutting charge than masonry for 
members of equal size. But, owing to the ease with which holes 
can be bored in it, it can be demolished fairly easily by 
small "borehole" charges. 

4. FIXING OF CHARGES . 

a) Cutting Charges . - The charge should cover the full breadth of 
the surface to be cut, and be in direct contact with it. The 
cross-section of the charge should be as nearly as possible in 
the shapre of an inverted "U" where explosives of a plastic 
nature are employed. In the case of slab explosives, the cross 
section of the charge should be as nearly as possible square. 
This arrangement will ensure that the maximum shearing effect 
is produced. All portions of the charge must be in close 
contact; sympathetic detonation, even in the case of 
dynamites, CANNOT be relied upon. Incomplete detonation means 
incomplete destruction. 

"THE DEMOLITION MUST NEVER FAIL." 

The charge as a whole must be firmly fixed to the object to be 
destroyed. 

c) Concussion Charges . - Principally employed in the destruction 
of buildings. An explosive with a low velocity of detonation 
should be used. Charges should be placed if possible against 
an essential part of the structure. It is important that all 
doors, windows and chimneys through which air can escape 
should be closed. Charges in adjoining rooms should not be 
placed opposite one another. 










SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 337 


5. CALCULATION OF CHARGES , 
a) Cutting charges . - 
Steel or iron rounds: 

C = 2/3d‘ Slabs G.C. or T.N.T. 

C = 4d ; oz. of P.E. or "808" 

(Minimum charge 2 ozs.) 

Where C = Weight of charge in slabs of G.C. or T.N.T. or 
weight of charge in ounces of P.E. or "808" 

d = the diameter of the round in inches. 

Use this formula for cable or "steel wire rope", and for 
hollow rounds. 

Steel or iron plates: 

C = l/8bt2 Slabs G.C. or T.N.T. 

C = 3/2bt2 ozs. P.E. or "808" 

(Minimum charge 2 ozs.) 

Where C = Weight of charge as above 

b = the full breadth of the plate 

t = the thickness of the plate in inches. 

Calculation for girders or "R.S.J.'s" must be dealt with by 
the intelligent application of the above formula to every 
portion of the section on which it is desired to cut. 

b) M_jne d ..changes ■ - 

Behind masonry abutments or retaining walls and in rock and 
masonry: 

C = D 3 /50 lbs. of Ammonal or T.N.T. powder. 

Under roads or in hard ground (i.e. clay, chalk, etc.) 

C = DV100 lbs. of Ammonal or T.N.T. powder. 

In soft ground (i.e. sand, peat, etc.) 

C = DV200 lbs. of Ammonal or T.N.T. powder. 

Where C = weight of explosion in lbs. 

D = diameter of required crater in feet.

1. A TTA CKING RAIL TRANS PORT. 

a) Importance of Targets . Main object to delay traffic and 
reduce the number of locos, and rolling stock available to 
enemy. 

b) Methods . Derailment - systematic rail cutting - attacks on 
stationary locos., station facilities - signals and 
communications. 

c) Derailment . Two main methods are: 

i) To make a gap in the rails. 

ii) By obstruction to cause the flange of the train's wheels 
to ride up on top of the rail and so off the rail. 

Trains are self-destroying targets: 

i) Wit h H.E. 

- Using Fog-Signals or Pressure Switches and 2 linked 
charges of 2 - 2 - 1 " 2 " cartridges, make train itself 
fire the charges so as to cut out a piece of rail at 
least 1 metre long ahead of the engine. 

- Using the same system but placing the charges at the 
last minute so as to avoid a pilot-engine. In this 
case firing could be done by short Bickford fuses or 
as before. 

Remember to take care of 'check' rails, if any, as 
well, and note the effect of a steeply banked curve in 
counteracting centrifugal force. 

ii) Without H.E. 

- By displacing a rail on the outside of a bend. 

- By obstructions in crossing-points, i.e. fishplates or 
crowbars in the "diamond". 

- By interference with facing-points, i.e. a 1" nut tied 
to the face of the switch-tongue. (This method only 
works at hand-operated points at remote places or in 
sidings.)

NOTE: 


i) How can you tell whether a tank is full or empty? 

ii) How can you tell whether a tank contains oil or 
petrol? 

iii) Neutralize elaborate FIRE precautions. 


(i) Get someone to tell you! 

(ii) Smell of petrol vapour round Petrol Tanks - and Oil 
Tanks have heating coils round inlet valves.) 


c) Attacking Storage Tanks . 

i) Tanks below ground extremely difficult to tackle. 

ii) Above-ground Tanks are often surrounded with anti-blast 
brick walls and inaccessible except near the inlet valve. 
In principle the method of attack will always be to get 
the fuel out into the air, having arranged an incendiary 
parcel or several individual incendiaries to receive and 
set fire to the fuel. This can be done either by: 

- Cutting a hole in the tank with H.E. (a special charge is 
needed for this and specialist instruction would be given 
at a later stage to students requiring it - or 

- By mechanical means, i.e. opening valves and unloading 
joints in outlet pipes. 

Note that the quickest way of setting fire to oils with a high 
'flash-point' is to pour paraffin over the surface and then 
throw lighted rags in from the windward side. 

iii) The easiest fuel targets are undoubtedly the smaller, 
mobile tank wagons such as Railway Tank Wagons . Road 
Wagons and Airfield Filler Tanks or "Bowsers", for which 
an ordinary 1-lb. charge of H.E. is quite sufficient - 
placed on the underside and used with an incendiary. 

5. ATTACKING AIRCRAFT . 

a) Place l- l -- 2 -lb. charge as near as possible to a fuel tank. Best 
positions as follows: 

Single-engine (Fighters! . 

i) In the cockpit under or behind the pilot’s seat. (Latter 
position accessible in the ME 109 via a locker behind the 
pilot's head and in the F.W. 190 via the port side 
inspection door. 















344 SOE SYLLABUS 


ii) On the fuselage skin under the pilot's seat fastened by 
tapes. 

b) Using the Altimeter Switch . Attack aircraft in the air with 

1 - 1 -^ 2 -lb. charges inserted into one of the many available 
spaces and in contact with a main structure member, e.g. in 
the tail unit, rear fuselage, machine gun or cannon space, 
undercarriage recess. 

c) Sniping with rifle and tracer ammo, during the 2 hours after 
an aircraft has landed in winter holds definite possibilities 
of igniting the petrol, if not of exploding the petrol vapour, 
German aviation spirit becoming explosive between -5 degrees 
C. and a lower limit. 

Gliders . Vulnerable to Incendiaries: place inside the fuselage if 
possible. 

6. ATTACKING INDUSTRIAL INSTALLATIONS. 

In attacking machinery, bear in mind that the majority of main 
frame components of most machines are made of CAST IRON, and, in 
consequence, the value of being able to distinguish CAST IRON 
from STEEL. 


Hints: 



CAST IRON

i) 

Much rougher before painting. 


ii) 

Smooth curves. 

Sharper angles. 

iii) 

Smooth surface. 

Ridge(s) of weld metal. 

iv) 

Raised lettering. 

Name plate. 

v) 

Sweeping curves on lugs. 

Lugs and/or protrusions 
fitted at sharp angles. 

Vi) 

CHISEL TEST: Flake. 

Peel. 

vii) 

Bolt holes machined 
and 'SPOT FACED'. 

Bolt holes just drilled. 

Also 

, of course, there is the possibility of encountering CAST 


STEEL. However, it is not normally used for machine FRAMES, as it 
is, i) expensive, ii) difficult to cast, iii) only used where 
heavy stresses or strains will be encountered - or where 
excessively high pressures will have to be withstood. 

Take as good example of Cast Iron target the Bearing Pedestal of 
a RUNNING Generator. Two 'sausage' charges: one on each corner of 
the short side, about one third of the way up from the base, will 
wreck the pedestal, also cause the rotating part of the generator 
to drop on to the casing. As this part will probably be rotating 
at high speed, the damage will be extensive. 

Industrial Structures . 

Some typical industrial structures common to Power Stations and 
Factories, etc: 








SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 345 


a) Coal Handling Plant ; essential where it is required to 

handle large quantities of coal very 
quickly. 


i) Coal conveyers: The higher from the ground the better, 

i.e. further to fall! Attack towers and 
supports. 

ii) Skip-Hoists: Again - the higher the better. 

Attack supports. 


iii) Wagon Tipplers: Impossible to handle large quantities 

of coal quickly without these. 

Attack with charges immediately below 
bearings at either end. 


b) Cr an e s : Cra n es, D o ck s ide or Cra ne s mo unt ed _gn St ru ctures: 

Very good target, always attack as many as possible 
at same time. 

Method recommended : 


i) For fixed cranes cut all legs at base and a section out of 
two legs on whichever side the crane is required to fall. 

ii) For mobile cranes (more common) only necessary to cut a 
section out of the two front (dockside) legs. 

c) Transformers : Information essential in order that attacks are 
confined to important transformers. 

Identify transformers by Oil Cooling Tank on top. Also - three 
main types: 

i) Cooling Tubes round Winding Casing. 

ii) Corrugated Cooling Surface to Casing. 

iii) Separate Banks of Radiators at right angles to plain 
casing, on very large transformers. 

ATTACK - all types by placing charge (Standard Sausage for i) 
and iii) a charge moulded into the corrugation for ii)) in 
centre of long, low-voltage side (less insulation) about one 
quarter of the way up. Use incendiaries to ignite oil, 
provided they do not interfere with the amount of H.E. 
carried. 


IMPORTANT : Do not confuse Transformers with Switch-Gear, which 
is very often non-essential, and therefore a bad target. 

d) Wireless Masts : Triangular type resting on ball and socket 
joint, comparatively easy to fell. 

ATTACK - Cut sufficient Tie-Bars connecting 'stays' to 
concrete anchors to make mast fall across station equipment. 











346 SOE SYLLABUS 


FINALLY, stress that although High-Tension Pylons would appear 
to be good targets, in reality they are NOT. Reasons: Towns 
and factories almost invariably have alternative sources of 
supply, (ii) Very short time required to arrange emergency 
supply, i.e. probably less than 48 hours. 

Taking these points into consideration, it is advisable only 
to attack H.T. Pylons when very large widespread attack is 
possible.

THE ESSENTIAL FACTORS OF FIRST AID IN THE FIELD 


AIM . 

To preserve life, hasten recovery or prevent aggravation of injury 
concerned. 

INTRODUCTION . 

First Aid is the assistance given at a time of accident, making use 
of available material. Improvisation especially in the field is 
usually necessary, for example, the use of sticks, rifles, etc. for 
splints, handkerchiefs and various articles of clothing for 
dressings. 

In dealing with an injured man one must at once: 

a) Determine the nature of the case, 

b) Decide what treatment is required according to circumstances 
which, in war, are liable to complicate, and in some cases 
prevent the ideal treatment being carried out. However, in most 
cases it is possible to strike a happy medium, by first of all 
patching up the wounded man, and then going out to complete the 
job in hand. 

It should be the duty of all at the present time to know the 
essential facts about first aid to the injured. Lives are more 
precious than ever, so, not only must we learn to kill the enemy, 
but also learn the fundamental facts of emergency treatment in order 
that we will be in a position to save the lives of others and our 
own selves, that we may live to fight another day. 

The following notes deal primarily with first aid in the field where 
in many cases elaborate medical and surgical equipment will not be 
available. 


WOUNDS . 


There are five main types: 


1. Abrasions. 

2. Lacerated Wounds. 

3. Incised Wounds. 

4. Contused Wounds. 

5. Punctured Wounds. 


Slight injury - unimportant from first aid 
point of view. 

Ragged edges, usually extensive damage to 
tissues; bleeding is not always great as 
vessels may be torn irregularly. 

Regular edges, tend to bleed freely, caused 
by cutting instruments. 

Caused by blunt instruments. There is much 
bruising giving rise to swelling and 
discolouration. 

Caused by penetrating instruments, e.g. 
knives, bayonets, bullets. May give rise to 
serious damage in deeper structures. Such a 
wound may become infected (poisoned). 





348 SOE SYLLABUS 


COMPLICATIONS OF WOUNDS . 

When a man is wounded, three main things have to be fought: 

1. Bleeding. 2. Shock. 3. Blood poisoning. 

1. Bleeding or Haemorrhage . 

This is perhaps the most important subject in first aid. In order to 
carry out treatment efficiently it is necessary to know a few facts 
about the blood and its circulation. 

a) Blood . 

The average man has 10 to 12 pints of blood. The fluid portion is 
the serum which clots when it is outside the body, thus assisting 
in the arrest of haemorrhage. The remainder of the blood consists 
of red corpuscles which carry oxygen to the tissues, and white 
blood corpuscles which tend to destroy germs. 

Death is likely to take place if a quantity of blood is lost. The 
ra pid loss of a pint of blood may be fatal, but a similar loss 
over a period of minutes is not likely to cause death. 

The above facts indicate that speed is an all important factor in 
the treatment of haemorrhage. 

b) Course of the Main Blood Vessels . 

It is necessary to have a mental picture of the positions of the 
arteries, names are unimportant. (This subject will not be 
referred to in detail, the essential points will be illustrated 
by means of a chart.) 

c) Pressure Points• 

These are located over a bone background so that pressure may be 
effective. In severe bleeding it may be necessary to apply 
pressure at these points in order to prevent arterial blood 
reaching the wound. The points are as follows: 

Carotid - at lower part of neck 
Facial - as it passes over the lower jaw 
Occipital - at the bank of the head 
Temporal - in front of the ear 
Subclavian - above the collar bone 
Axillary - in armpit 

Brachial - by fingers under inner edge of biceps 

Radial and Ulnar - one either side of the wrist 

Femoral - in centre of groin 

Popliteal - behind knee 

Anterior Tibial - in front of ankle 

Posterior Tibial - on inner side of heel bone 


(A practical demonstration will be given on the above.) 






SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 349 


The above pressure points can be easily located by means of 
feeling the pulsations in the artery, e.g. Radial Artery at 
wrist. 

d) Characteristics of Bleeding . 

i) Capillary Haemorrhage : Blood is red, bleeding is not 
serious. 

ii) Venous Haemorrhage : Blood is dark red, and tends to flow 

from the end of wound farthest from the heart. Can be quite 
severe. 

iii) Arterial Haemorrhage : As the blood pressure is high in the 
arteries, blood tends to escape with more force. It spurts 
out on each contraction of the heart. The blood is bright 
red. This type of bleeding is most dangerous, and treatment 
must be carried out without delay. 

TREATMENT OF ARTERIAL HAEMORRHAQE. 

1. Lay patient down and raise the injured part. 

2. Apply a pad directly on the wound and tie in position with a firm 
bandage. The pocket field dressing is suitable for this. It may 
be necessary to improvise, e.g. handkerchiefs, ties, etc. In most 
cases bleeding can be controlled by the above means. 

3. If bleeding is obviously very severe, then immediate digital 
pressure may have to be applied to the respective pressure point 
until the necessary dressings are procured, e.g. an incised wound 
severing the femoral artery in the thigh, pressure must be 
applied at once to the groin by means of both thumbs. 

4. If direct pressure over the wound fails to control the 
haemorrhage, then other methods must be employed. What is called 
"pad and flexion" may be used if the wound is situated well below 
the knee or elbow. In the case of the lower limb a large pad is 
placed behind the knee and the leg bent so that the back of the 
heel practically comes in contact with the back of the thigh. The 
limb is fixed in position by means of a "figure of eight" bandage. 
In the case of the arm the pad is placed in front of the elbow. 

5. It may be necessary in some cases to apply a Tourniquet, which is 
merely a constricting band, which is placed between the wound and 
the heart in order to cut down the flow of blood. Improvisation 
again has to be carried out. A small flat stone covered by a 
handkerchief, a tie and piece of stick, pencil or pen are 
required. The pad formed by the stone is placed over the artery 
and the tie or handkerchief fixed in position round the limb, 
incorporating and pressing on the pad. A half knot is made and 
the pencil is used to twist the tourniquet tight. The tourniquet 
in itself is a dangerous thing if care is not employed, liable to 








350 SOE SYLLABUS 


cause death (gangrene) of limb if left in position too long or 
applied too tightly. 

Rules for Tourniquet . 

1. Don't tie too tight. Stop twisting when bleeding is 
controlled, do not give two or three extra turns for luck. Too 
much pressure may damage the main artery to limb. 

2. Relax pressure every fifteen minutes. 

3. Never leave a man alone for any length of time with the 
tourniquet in position if it is at all possible. Gangrene is 
likely to set in after six hours. 

4. Elevate limb if there is time. 

WARNING. Many wounded were aggravated in the last war through 
improper use of tourniquets. They are seldom required and should 
only be applied to the arm and thigh. If a man is bleeding from 
the neck, do not apply a tourniquet! 

2. Shock . 

In any serious injury shock is liable to develop, especially 
after wounds caused by gunfire, bombs and explosives. From the 
first-aider's point of view it is a very important subject, 
because he can do much to prevent its onset or if it has already 
developed he can help to control the condition. 

It is caused primarily by failure of the circulation, the blood 
pressure falls, the man becomes pale, cold, and the skin is 
clammy. The pulse at wrist is very feeble, his lips and ears take 
on a bluish tint. His breathing is shallow and sighing. Death 
soon follows if action is not taken. 

TREATMENT OF SHOCK . 

1. Relieve pain. This can be done by making the patient 
comfortable, e.g. fixing up injured limb by means of splints 
and bandages. Morphia, gr. , may be given. 1 tablet under 
tongue allowed to dissolve slowly. 

2. Keep patient warm, cover with blankets and coats above and 
below. You may be required to take off some of your own 
clothing. If circumstances allow get the patient under cover. 
Hot water bottles should be obtained. 

3. Hot drinks, such as hot sweet tea. DO NOT GIVE ALCOHOL if 
patient is still exposed to the elements. 

4. Keep at rest in a recumbent position. 

5. If haemorrhage is present then, of course, it must be arrested 
before anything else is done. 





SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 351 


3. Blood Poisoning . 

All wounds are contaminated, that is, they contain a certain 
amount of dirt which usually harbours bacteria (germs). The only 
clean wound in the proper sense of the word is the incision made 
by the surgeon on the operating table. In the latter case his 
hands and knife are surgically clean, and likewise the skin of 
the patient. 

A wound that is contaminated is very likely to become infected, 
which means that the germs proliferate and invade the tissues. 

Any large wound is considered to be infected if it has not been 
cleansed within six hours of receiving injury. This cleansing, 
however, is a job for the surgeon in hospital. In the field it is 
well nigh impossible to clean a wound. 

Prevention of blood poisoning in the field consists of covering 
the wound with a dressing as sterile as possible. If there is 
obvious dirt on the surface and on the surrounding skin, this may 
be removed by running water, preferably boiled and allowed to 
cool. Penetrating foreign bodies such as stones, bomb fragments, 
etc. should be left in situ. The patient should then be 
transported to hospital where the wound can be dealt with. 
Circumstances may prevent this last move, in certain 
circumstances it may be permissible to carry out a more thorough 
cleansing of the wound. Soap and water are the safest preparation 
to use. Iodine must never be applied to a large wound as this not 
only destroys some of the germs, but also tends to kill the white 
blood corpuscles which play a big part in defending the body from 
infection. Chemical antiseptics give a false sense of security 
for the above reason. 


WQWNDS-- PRINCIPLES-QF—TREATfgSI• 

1. Arrest bleeding - treat shock. 

2. Remember danger of removing imbedded fragments - this may 
cause further damage and bleeding. 

3. Cleanse - depending on circumstances. 

4. Apply dressing (field) and fix in position. 

5. Apply some support if wound is extensive. 


FBACTUBE5• 

There are two principal varieties: 


1. Simple - where bone alone is damaged. 

2. Compound - where bone, tissue and skin are all damaged. 





352 SOE SYLLABUS 


a) Evidence of Fractures . 

i) Pain, swelling and tenderness, 

ii) Loss of rigidity - giving rise to disability and unnatural 
mobility. 

iii) Crepitus - caused by fragments of bone scraping together. 

b) Dangers of Fractures . 

i) Increased damage, fracture may become compound, or damage to 
nerve or blood vessel, 

ii) Shock, 

iii) Infection. 

c) Treatment of Fractures . 

i) Prevent further damage by rest, correct posture and 
fixation, 

ii) Shock. 

iii) Proper transport. 

e) Com pound Fracture - 

i) Arrest haemorrhage, 

ii) Cover wound. 

iii) Do not replace protruding bone. Carefully fix limb by 
splints or sling. 


SPLINTS- 

Provide support, proper alignment, and prevent movement. They must 
be strong and stiff, e.g. sticks, rifles, newspapers rolled, etc. 
and of the proper length. The splint should incorporate the adjacent 
joints to the fracture. For example, in a broken forearm, the 
splints should come beyond the elbow and wrist. 

Meth p d . of . A p plication . 

a) Pad with something soft, and prepare ties which are placed around 
limb and splints so as to avoid the actual site of fracture. 

b) Use gentle, sustained traction to get limb in good position. For 
example, broken thigh bone, pull gently on ankle until injured 
limb lies along sound limb. 

c) Fix splints in position, making certain that they do not press on 
arteries and thereby interfere with blood supply. For example, in 
arm feel for pulse of wrist. 

Fractured Spine . 

Caused by crushing or fall. Two cardinal symptoms: 

a) Paralysis of limbs. 

b) Loss of sensation below the break. Patient does not feel 
pin-prick. 

If in doubt treat any severe back injury as a fracture. 










SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 353 


Treatment . 

Great care must be taken in moving the patient as further damage 
may be done. Keep back as rigid as possible. 

Transport . 

If unconscious or neck is broken, carry face up. If neck is 
injured apply large pad behind the neck and place head slightly 
back. 

If conscious and back is broken, carry face downwards. 

Transfer to Stretcher . 

Several bearers required so as to move patient en bloc.

ii) If conscious, get patient to hold his tongue forward by 
placing his finger in mouth, 

iii) Bandage under chin over top of scalp.

Caused by bullets, bomb fragments, etc. May be small, or very 
large gaping wounds, exposing lungs. 

Treatment . 

i) Sit patient up. 

ii) Complete rest essential, 

iii) Apply dressing to wound. 

iv) If gaping wound or if air is obviously being drawn through 
wound, a large pad, soaked if possible in sterile water, 
should be applied to form an airtight dressing. This will 
give much relief and in many cases will save life. 










354 SOE SYLLABUS 


War Injuries of Upper Limb . 

There are three factors to be considered: 

i) Haemorrhage. If limb is smashed, or shot away, or if 
bleeding comes from main artery, then tourniquet may be 
applied. In other cases use pad and bandage, 

ii) Wound. Field dressing. 

iii) Fracture. "Splint 'em where they lie". Splints may be used or in 
some cases the arm may be fixed to the body to irrrrobilise it. 

War Injuries of Lower Limb . 

Bandaging the legs together is good emergency treatment when no 
splints are available. 

Thomas Splint ideal for serious injury to thigh. Saved many lives 
in Great War, because it reduced pain and thereby cut down the 
incidence of shock. 

Injuries around knee tend to be serious and should be evacuated 
to hospital at once. First aid - apply dressing and immobilise. 

War I Q j urje s__o_f _Head - 

Keep patient quiet. Adjust patient's clothing and posture. Assist 
breathing by holding jaw well up, by pressure under chin. Do not 
attempt to give fluids. Bleeding alarming but not serious as a 
rule. Pad and bandage will control it. 

Compression may result following head injury. Symptoms may be 
delayed. Patient becomes unconscious some time after injury. 

Pulse becomes very slow. 

It the above symptoms are noted every endeavour should be made to 
get the patient to hospital. In most cases a trephining operation 
is indicated. 

War In j uries q f Abdgmen . 

Keep patient flat on his back. If wound gaping, draw knees up, 
raise head and shoulders slightly. Give nothing by mouth. 

If intestines protrude through the wound, cover with a large 
dressing, preferably soaked in salt solution (1 teaspoonful to a 
pint of water). Keep dressing moist. 

Eve Iniuries . 

If the eye is obviously seriously damaged, apply a simple pad, 
fixed by a bandage round head and keep patient lying flat in 
order to reduce pressure on injured eye. 

FIRST AID IN ASPHYXIA . 


E.g. Drowning, foreign body causing choking.

TREATMENT . 


Artificial Respiration. (This will be demonstrated). 

FIRST AID IN BURNS . 

1. Patient trapped in a burning room. First aid worker should apply 
wet handkerchief over mouth and nose and crawl along the floor, 
keeping flat to avoid flames, pull the patient out. If asphyxiated 
(breathing practically stopped) carry out artificial respiration. 

2. If clothes on fire lay patient down, and cover with coat or rug 
to smother flames. 

3. Patient in contact with electric current: 

a) If possible break circuit. Push patient off by means of dry 
stick, rescuer standing on some dry non-conductor, e.g. wood, 
newspaper. 

b) Artificial respiration. 

c) Treat burns. 

4. Patient with scalds caused by burst boilers or pipes: 

a) Do not expose burned surface. 

b) Treat for shock. 

c) Exposed burn covered with clean dry sheet or dressing. First 
aid preparations, e.g. tannic acid, are seldom required, they 
usually interfere with ultimate treatment. 

Albucid made up in tubes is perhaps the safest application if 
medical attention is likely to be unavailable for several hours. 
This might be carried in operations.

against. 

TRANSPORT OF INJURED PERSONS . 

As a rule, transport is bad for the patient who has been 
seriously injured, but in many cases it is necessary. 

Splinting and bandaging should be carried out before any attempt 
is made to move the men with severe wounds. 

(Various methods of transport will be demonstrated, e.g. - hand 
carrying and improvisation of stretchers, etc.)

PHYSICAL TRAINING 

Physical training throughout the course is progressive and leads up 
to the final stamina tests of the Assault Course and the 24 Hour 
long distance Trek. 

The object is to increase the general physical fitness of the 
students and to fit them for their course at S.T.S.51. With this in 
view special attention is paid to the following: 

a) Physical Exercises - P.T. and games to make students supple and 
to increase their all-round bodily fitness. 

b) Tumbling - to break the fall when landing from any reasonable 
height. 

c) Rope work - to strengthen the arms and in particular to enable 
students to pull themselves up, i.e. to lift their own weight. 

d) Crossing of obstacles - so that men shall not be held up either 
when they are approaching their objective nor when they are 
getting away. 

e) Hill work - incidental to all training - but excellent for 
strengthening ankles. 

The time of day during which P.T. is carried out will depend upon 
the various seasons of the year. 

The course culminates in an obstacle course - perhaps better called 
an Assault Course or Combined Training Course. In this, students are 
confronted with specially designed and natural obstacles spaced over 
a course, which also includes firing with all the weapons they have 
used during training. The layout of the various courses varies, but 
each one is basically the same. Each course is based on a narrative 
scheme. Points are awarded for time, shooting, and ability and style 
in crossing obstacles. 

This is a valuable exercise for assessing the stamina as well as the 
determination and progress of the students. 

Combined with the long hill trek, the assault course gives 
instructors a good indication both of a student's physical stamina 
and of his character under difficult conditions.

CLOSE COMBAT 


PREFACE . 

1. Designed to teach how to fight and kill without firearms. Since 
the course includes the use of the knife, "close combat" is not 
strictly correct. "Silent Killing" is a more appropriate 
description. 

2. Time available to students is limited. It is essential, 
therefore, to confine the teaching to what is simple, easily 
learned and deadly . With that object, all holds, throws, etc., 
that do not merit this description have been rigorously excluded. 
The syllabus which follows must now be regarded as standard and 
instructors, therefore, will please not deviate from it in any 
way whatever. It is plainly undesirable that students should be 
taught one method in one place and another method somewhere else. 

3. The syllabus includes various suggestions by instructors 
themselves. Further suggestions, if they constitute improvements, 
will be welcomed. Such suggestions must be put forward through 
the proper channels and must not be taught to students until 
sanction has been received. 

4. Dummies are essential. Six should be provided, slung irregularly 
in a space approximately 10 or 12 feet square. In addition, each 
instructor must make a straw-filled dummy for practice with the 
knife. 

5. Other Equipment . German steel helmets are available and each 
instructor should have one, for practice in sentry attacks. Dummy 
knives are useful but care should be taken that they are of some 
material which will not cause injury. Wood, for that reason, is 
not permissible. Rubber is unobtainable. The most practical 
solution appears to be short lengths of suitably thick rope. 

6. Kit, etc . Ordinary P.T. kit is best though, at suitable 
intervals, students should practise in the kit that they are most 
likely to wear in the field. Students should not always be paired 
off in equal sizes. Sometimes, small men should be paired with 
big men. 

7. When commencing the course with a class of untrained students, 
the instructor should make a short introduction, not necessarily 
in the same words but to the same effect as the following: 

"This system of combat is designed for use when you have lost 
your firearms, which is something you should not do, or when the 
use of firearms is undesirable for fear of raising an alarm. 

"At some time or other, most of you, probably, have been taught 








362 SOE SYLLABUS 


at least the rudiments of boxing, under the Queensbury rules. 

That training was useful because it taught you to think and move 
quickly and how to hit hard. The Queensbury rules enumerate, 
under the heading of "fouls", some good targets which the boxer 
is not trained to defend. 

"This, however, is WAR , not sport. Your aim is to kill your 
opponent as quickly as possible. A prisoner is generally a 
handicap and a source of danger, particularly if you are without 
weapons. So forget the Queensbury rules; forget the term "foul 
methods". That may sound cruel but it is still more cruel to take 
longer than necessary to kill your opponent. "Foul methods" so- 
called, help you to kill quickly. Attack your opponent's weakest 
points, therefore. He will attack yours if he gets a chance. 

"There have been many famous boxers and wrestlers who time after 
time have won their contests with their favourite blows or holds. 
The reason is that they had so perfected those particular blows 
and holds that few could withstand them. The same applies to you. 
If you will take the trouble to perfect one method of attack, you 
will be far more formidable than if you only become fairly good 
at all the methods which you will be shown. 

"Since this course of instruction is meant to teach you to kill, 
it will be plain to you that its methods are dangerous. Your 
object here is to learn how to kill but it is quite unnecessary 
to kill or damage your sparring partner, you will get no credit 
if you do. In learning and practising, therefore, you will avoid 
taking any risks of that kind. You must never disregard the 
submission signal - two taps on your opponent's body or on your 
own, or on the floor. It is the signal to stop instantly and that 
is a rule which must never be broken." 

8. The syllabus is divided into six progressive sections. This 
arrangement is to be regarded, however, as elastic. Depending on 
such considerations as time available, progress made by students 
or their standard of knowledge, there is no reason, for example, 
why two or more sections should not be amalgamated. 

9. One of the primary objects of the instructor is to make his 
students attack-minded, and dangerously so. No effort should be 
spared to realise this object, which should be regarded as one of 
the instructor's chief responsibilities. No instructor should be 
satisfied unless his students become thoroughly proficient in the 
performance of the few simple things enumerated in the syllabus. 
Dull as it may become, constant repetition is the only road to 
proficiency and constant repetition there must be, no matter how 
much students may complain of boredom. Their business is to 
learn, at any cost. By proficiency is meant the ability to 
execute all the requirements of the syllabus swiftly, effectively 
and neatly, without having to stop to think. 


SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 363 


The Syllabus 


SECTION 1 . 

Blows with the side of the hand . Explain that the most deadly blows 
without the aid of weapons are those with the side of the hand. To 
deliver them effectively the fingers must be together, thumb up, and 
the whole hand tensed. The blow is struck with the side of the hand, 
all the force being concentrated in one small area, i.e. 
approximately half-way between the base of the little finger and the 
wrist joint, or where the hand is broadest. If striking sideways, 
the back of the hand must be uppermost. No force can be obtained if 
the palm is uppermost. 

Explain that with these blows, it is possible to kill, temporarily 
paralyse, break bones or badly hurt, depending upon the part of the 
body that is struck. The effect of these blows is obtained by the 
speed with which they are delivered rather than by the weight behind 
them. They can be made from almost any position, whether the striker 
is on balance or not, and thus can be delivered more quickly than 
any other blow. 

Having explained the blows, the instructor should demonstrate them 
on the dummies and get the students to practise after him. His main 
point here is to bring out the speed of the blows and to see that 
students deliver them correctly. 

Students should now be shown where to strike, as follows, explaining 
the effect on each particular point: 

1. On the back of the neck, immediately on either side of the spine. 

2. From the bridge of the nose to the base of the throat. 

3. On either side of the head and throat, from base of the throat to 
the temple area. 

4. On the upper arm. 

5. On the fore arm. 

6. The kidney region. 

Students should practise on the dummies again, keeping in mind the 
vulnerable points listed above. Strike with either hand. 

SECTION 2 . 

Qthe.r_.Bl ow .S - 

How to kick . As a general rule, kick with the side of the foot and, 
unless you possess unusually good foot work and balance, don't kick 
above knee height. Never kick too foremost unless your opponent has 
both hands occupied. In that case, it is safe to kick to the fork. 
Once the opponent is down, kill by kicking the side or back of the 
head ( not the top of the head). 









364 SOE SYLLABUS 


The boxing blows . 

The open-hand chin iab . fingers held back and apart ready to follow 
up to the eyes. Utilise the occasion to obtain some improvement in 
foot-work, explaining that the body must be properly positioned in 
order to obtain telling effect from either boxing blows or the open- 
hand chin jab. Explain, too, that neither can secure more than a 
knock-out, which should be followed up instantly by a killing 
attack. 

Use of the Knee , often in simultaneous combination with other 
attacks (e.g. with the chin-jab). Show how, while being used for 
attack, it is an excellent guard for oneself. 

Use of the head and elbows , for attack when the opponent is not in 
position for more effective blows. 

Finger-tip iabs . to solar plexus, base of throat, or eyes, when 
nothing more effective can be done. 

All the blows listed should be practised new on the dummies. 

Conclude this section by telling students, as emphatically as 
possible: 

a) That they should never go to ground if they can help it. If they 
have to, they should get up again as soon as they can. While a 
man is killing his opponent on the ground, the opponent's friends 
could walk up and kick his brains out. Again, while on the 
ground, it is difficult to go on attacking. 

b) That if their knowledge of the subject is confined to the 
contents of Sections 1 and 2, they will have made themselves 
extremely dangerous, even to highly trained adversaries, if only 
the y w i l l attac k fi r st an d K eep o n attack in g . Don't stop just 
because an opponent is crippled. If you have broken his arm, for 
instance, that is only of value because it is then easier to 
kill. 

SECTIQSLJ. 

Releases fro m.ho l ds. 

Explain first that, in general nobody should be so slow in wits or 
body as to allow someone else to get a hold on him. In case of 
misfortune, however, show how to effect release from: 

A wrist hold, taken with one hand. 

A wrist hold, taken with two hands. 

A throat hold, taken with one hand. 

A throat hold, taken with two hands. 

Show here how, instead of the customary wrist-and-elbcw release or one 
of its variants, it is far simpler, quicker and more effective to 
attack, e.g. knee to the fork and fingers to the eyes, simultaneously. 











SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 365 


A body hold, from front or rear, arms free and arms pinioned. 
Police or "come-along" holds. 

The whole idea of releasing yourself from a hold is to enable you to 
attack and kill your adversary. Whenever possible, the disengaging 
movement should form the commencement of an attack. In any case, 
there must be an effective and instant follow-up attack after every 
release. The instructor should demonstrate most carefully every 
detail to do with this Section and then insist on students 
practising until not only the mode of release but the subsequent 
attack becomes a matter of instinct, to be carried out at lightning 
speed. The instructor should emphasise the importance of footwork, 
and, where necessary, try to improve it. 

SECTION 4 . 

Crowd Fig h t in g. 

One cannot always choose when one will fight and it may sometimes 
happen that one is faced with several opponents at once. On such 
occasions, unarmed yourself, your object is not so much to kill your 
opponents as to get quickly away from them so that you do not get 
killed. Pride is expensive if it entails defeat and death. 

To escape from circumstances like these, a special technique is 
necessary. 

For the technique, balance is essential and the instructor should 
now demonstrate how to keep on balance when swift movement is 
necessary in kicking while standing on one foot. Students can be 
paired off and, standing on one foot, arms folded, they should try 
to kick each other off balance whilst maintaining their own balance. 

Once this is mastered, it should be explained that, surrounded by a 
crowd, your only chance of escape lies in continual movement. This 
is so because, after you have taken up a new position it requires a 
second for an opponent to turn and balance before he is able to 
strike you with any force. If one moves at least three feet in each 
second, there is obviously little chance of an opponent scoring an 
effective hit on you. At the same time, by the use of the blows 
previously learned, you will be able to do considerable damage while 
you are moving. 

NOTE: 1. In addition to forward, backward and lateral movement, move 
also at different levels, sometimes with the knees very 
much bent. It all helps, if done at speed, to bewilder your 
adversaries. 

2. Of necessity, there will be little room for movement, so 
make room by moving against one opponent after another, 
attacking as you do so. Point out the value of the balance 
and foot work in which the students should have been 
practised at the beginning of this section. 

The information contained in the two above notes should suffice to 
prepare students for the actual practice, which is now outlined. 




366 SOE SYLLABUS 


Six dummies should be suspended as indicated in the preface. One 
student at a time should enter the ring and, with all the speed of 
which he is capable, should then attack the dummies at random, using 
every kind of blow with hand, foot, knee, elbow and head, from any 
position. 

The practice is very exhausting and it is difficult to keep it up 
for more than a minute. 

The instructor must watch carefully for faults so that he can give 
advice afterwards. 

Before the student tires he should be told to leave the ring and he 
will do so at speed, exactly as if he were actually making an 
escape. 

To derive the maximum benefit from this exercise it should first be 
done both by the instructor and the student in slow time, paying 
careful attention to footwork. 

It should then be followed by many short periods in the ring and 
only an occasional longer one. It must always be remembered that the 
aim is to get out of the place and not to fight any longer than 
necessary. 

S ECT ION $ . 

Knife Fighting . 

The knife is a silent and deadly weapon that is easily concealed and 
against which in the hands of an expert, there is no sure defence, 
except fire-arms or by running like hell. 

Students should be taught how to hold a knife, how to pass it from 
one hand to another, to thrust and how to use the disengaged hand to 
feint and parry. It is unnecessary to be ambidextrous to be able to 
use the knife with either hand. 

Show the vulnerable points, emphasising that the abdominal region is 
the principal target. Show how to make an opening for a thrust in 
the region, e.g. by slashing across face, hands, wrist and fore¬ 
arms, by flinging gravel, a stone, a hat, a handkerchief, etc., in 
the opponent's face. 

Explain the value of a really sharp point and edge, the latter, 
particularly with a double-edged knife, being as much to prevent the 
knife from being seized as for slashing. 

Show the ham-string slash at the back of the knee. 

Make students now practise thrusts at the straw-filled dummy. 

SECTION 6. 


For special needs and occasions: 





SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 367 


1. Killing a sentry, if you are armed with a knife . 

Attack from the rear. With left fore-arm, strike violently on 
left side of opponent's neck and instantly transfer the left hand 
to cover his mouth and nostrils. Simultaneously with the blow on 
the neck, thrust the knife (held in the right hand) into his 
kidneys. If equipment interferes with the kidney thrust, bring 
the hand round to the front and thrust into the abdomen. Note 
that once the left hand covers mouth and nostrils, the adversary 
is dragged backwards and downwards. 

2. Killing, absentrXi__ i f_yoi^_ a rg_ unh ar med. 

Attack from the rear. With right fore-arm, strike violently on 
right side of adversary's neck. Go immediately into the head-hold 
and take him down on to your thigh. Keeping the hold properly 
(i.e., right hand open and tensed, fore-arm between adversary's 
jaw and temple, left hand grasping right wrist so as to apply 
pressure, lifting up and twisting adversary's head), sit down 
instantly with legs stretched out in front of you. Instructors 
will see to it that their students, when practising with each 
other, do not sit down while keeping the hold. With a little 
ingenuity, it should be possible to adapt one of the dummies for 
practice. All that is necessary is to sling the dummy on a 
pulley. The instructor could release the cord and so allow the 
student to take the dummy to the ground. 

Needless to say, extreme speed is necessary for both methods of 
killing a sentry and both methods should be practised equally on 
right and left-hand sides. 

3. S pinal Pislocator, opponent sitting, or at a much lower level . 

Approach from rear. Left hand under chin, drag opponent's head 
back completely under your right arm-pit. Drop your left hand on 
his left shoulder and, passing your right arm across the back of 
his neck, grip your left wrist from above. The finishing touch is 
a quick snap upwards and backwards. A very dangerous hold and 
requires great care in practising. 

4. Disarming, if held up with a pistol . 

Explain first that only a fool would hold you up with his pistol 
within reach of your hands. Nevertheless, it is plainly evident 
that there are still a lot of such fools about and if you did not 
know how to deal with them it would be you who would feel a fool. 
From the front : 

Method A . Hands up, well above your head and wide apart. Don't 
look at the pistol. Bring your right hand down smartly on to his 
wrist, gripping it firmly with your thumb, preferably, above. 
Accompany the movement by a half turn to your left. 
Simultaneously, your left hand grips the pistol barrel from 
underneath and presses the pistol backwards. Note that while the 
pistol is being pressed backwards, its barrel should be parallel 
with the ground. This will break your opponent's trigger finger 
and give you possession of the pistol. Turning half right, 
attack, with foot or knee to the fork, open-hand chin-jab, butt 
with the top of your head or do anything calculated to knock your 
opponent out. Each movement has been described separately but, in 








368 SOE SYLLABUS 


actual practice, the several movements should be performed so 
quickly that they appear to be almost one. 

Method B . Hands up, well above your head and wide apart. Don't 
look at the pistol. Bring your left hand down smartly on to his 
wrist, gripping it firmly with your thumb, preferably, above. 
Accompany the movement by a half turn to your right. 
Simultaneously, your right hand grips the pistol barrel from 
underneath and presses the pistol upwards, backwards and over. 
This is practically the equivalent of the ordinary wrist throw 
and will give you possession of the pistol. Turning half left, 
attack . with foot or knee to the fork, open-hand chin-jab, butt 
with the top of the head, or do anything calculated to knock your 
opponent out. Each movement has been described in detail, but, in 
actual practice, the several movements should be performed so 
quickly that they appear to be almost one. 

From the rear : 

Method A . Hands up, well above your head and wide apart. Make up 
your mind which way you will turn. If to the left, look over your 
left shoulder, to make sure that it is the pistol which is 
touching your back. At the same time as you look over your 
shoulder, turn your right foot inwards. When you are ready to 
move, turn right round to the left, at the same time bringing 
your left arm down in a circular sweep over your opponent's 
pistol arm, continuing the sweeping motion until your opponent's 
arm is locked firmly under your left arm-pit. Simultaneously with 
your turning round, your right hand comes into position for a 
chin-jab or punch to the jaw and your right knee comes up to your 
opponent's fork. Finish the matter by turning smartly to your 
right, re-inforcing the movement with your right hand on the 
elbow of the arm which is still locked under your left arm-pit. 
This movement, if continued, will bring him across you, in 
position for either a smash to his face with your right knee or a 
side of the hand blow, with your right hand, on the back of his 
neck. All to be done with lightning speed. 

Method B . Hands up, well above your head and wide apart. Look over 
your right shoulder, turning your left foot inwards as you do so. 
Turn right round, to your right, locking your opponent's pistol 
arm, as described above, but under your right arm-pit. Meanwhile 
your left arm is coming round for a side of the hand blow across 
his throat or face. You are also in position to use your knee. 
Finish as described above, by turning to your right, etc. 

Disarming a man holding someone else up . If holding the pistol in 
his right hand, smash down with your left hand on his fore-arm at 
the elbow joint, simultaneously seizing the pistol from underneath 
with your right hand. Turn rapidly to your left until you are face 
to face with him, pressing the pistol upwards, towards him and 
finally to the left. Use your knee and butt with your head. 

Students should become proficient in all these five methods of 
disarming. 

5. Searching a prisoner, if you are armed . 

Kill him first. If that is inconvenient, make him lie face to the 









SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 369 


ground, hands out in front of him. Knock him out, with rifle butt, 
side or butt of the pistol or with your boot. Then search him. 

6. Taking a prisoner away, if you are armed with a rifle or 

ot he c fi rearm. 

Get someone to cut the prisoner's belt or braces, or make him do 
so himself. March him away, one of his hands above his head, the 
other holding up his trousers. 

7. S e curing a pris oner fg.r_s. 0 n 3 g. tj jne . 

Using 15 feet of cord and any effective knot, show the 
conventional method, i.e. knock him out, place him face down on 
the ground, tie his hands behind his back, lead the cord round 
his throat, back to his wrists, round both ankles, back to his 
wrists. Students should be told not to forget to take the cord 
with them. 

Having shown how to tie him up, show how to gag a prisoner. 

Almost anything will do to stuff in his mouth - turf, cloth, a 
forage cap, etc. For something to tie over his mouth, strips can 
be torn from the prisoner's clothing. It is useful if instructors 
will let students, once or twice during the course, go through 
the whole process of tying up and gagging, having handy some cord 
and strips of cloth for the purpose. It is not enough for 
students to be told how to do it; they must do it themselves. 

8. Defense against a.downward qf sideways blow. 

Presuming that you are utterly unable to get hold of any kind of 
weapon, no matter how crude, employ one of the following methods: 

a) Side-step and attack. 

b) Parry with the opposite fore-arm and attack. 

Students should know, at this stage of the training, how best to 
attack. 

VATigMS—Hols!gu_ TkrgHS^_ efcc . 

{not to be taught) 

This is a selection of holds, blows, throws, attacks, etc., which 
are known to every instructor. Sooner or later, some of the more 
knowing students are sure to ask the instructor if he knows this, 
that or the other hold, etc., and if so, why it is not taught. This 
list is intended to provide answers to such questions. 

If obliged by such questions to show some of these holds, etc., the 
instructor should: 

a) Demonstrate the objections, 

b) Demonstrate the appropriate releases or counters. 

c) Warn students that against a trained adversary, many of these 
holds, etc., would be difficult, risky or impossible to apply. 








370 SOE SYLLABUS 


d) Warn students of the unwisdom of assuming that their adversaries 
in this war will be untrained men. If students have mastered the 
far simpler and quicker methods of the syllabus, all the holds, 
etc., in the following list are entirely unnecessary. The 
(unarmed) defences against a rifle and bayonet are possibly the 
only exceptions. 

e) Holds designed to keep a man captive or to take him away as 

a prisoner. 

Point out that the man who attempts to use them for any purpose 
other than as a means to finish off an opponent should realise 
that he is running a considerable risk, a risk that is only 
justified if he has first crippled his opponent or if he 
possesses a marked and obvious superiority in physique or 
knowledge. 


Defences against a rifle and bayonet. 

Show particularly the one which consists of parrying the rifle or 
bayonet away to your left, using your right hand and making a 
simultaneous half left turn, stepping in immediately to your 
opponent's left-hand side and attacking at speed with hand, foot or 
both. Disregard the rifle once you are past the bayonet point. 

Explain that all the defences against a bayonet are apt to be 
extremely effective if you, unarmed, are exceptionally quick and if 
your opponent doesn't know his job. 

Bent-arm hold, as a defence agaj.ns.t_ a. &lt;downY&amp;rd..&amp;low J _ 

Why waste time? You have got to parry, in any case, so parry with 
one fore-arm and attack simultaneously with the knee and disengaged 
hand (chin-jab or punch to the jaw).

Why bother? Attack instead, knee to the fork, fingers to the eyes. 
Hhurn b . and . eltaaw h glc L 

Difficult to apply unless your opponent has lost his senses. Show 
how to escape from it. 

Head hold. 

Excellent for dealing with a sentry if carried instantly to its full 
conclusion. Don't use it merely as a hold, however, for it gives 
your opponent an opportunity for a crotch throw that can finish you. 

Arm and neck hold . 

Effective but with a quick opponent you are most unlikely to get it. 
Japanese Strangle. 

When the hand is in the correct position, i.e., almost on top of the 
head, you cannot prevent your opponent, if he is quick, from 
dragging your hand away. If the hand is held lower down, where it 
cannot be seized and dragged away, you are apt to lose the necessary 













SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 371 


leverage and the hold becomes ineffective. Also, again if your 
opponent is quick, he can sink with his full weight and the hold 
cannot be applied. It can only be applied if secured and taken to 
its conclusion with extreme speed. A steel helmet would probably 
make it very difficult to secure the hold. 

Rock-crusher . 

Only effective if delivered in exactly the right spot and if there 
is no equipment in the way. Why not use one of the other methods of 
attack? 

G rape- y in e . 

Useless as a means of keeping a man prisoner. It needs two men to 
apply it and if the prisoner does not escape (some men can), he may 
die before very long. If you want to kill him, do so, but don't 
torture him. If you want to keep him prisoner, tie him up. 

Match-box blow . 

Good, but you don't always have a match-box at the critical moment. 
Why not use the elbow, followed immediately by a chin-jab, side of 
the hand blow, or punch to the jaw? 

Baton and spring cosh . 

Open to the objection common to all forms of attack with the raised 
arm, in that they leave the attacker wide open. Directly the arm 
goes up (or sooner), step in close and use your knife. If you have 
no knife, step in closer and use chin-jab or punch, and the knee. If 
you yourself use a spring cosh and you miss your blow with the 
extreme end of the weapon, it is likely that you will only hit 
harmlessly with the spring. Both the baton and the spring cosh are a 
bit clumsy to carry about and it is doubtful if they are worth the 
trouble. 

gafet y-razor blade, or blades, in ca p p gflk - 

May be shown, in order that students may know what to expect, but 
the use of this device is not to be encouraged. 

All the following, good as some of them are, are open to the 
objection that while attempting to apply them, you make yourself 
very vulnerable to attack. Also if you are in a position to apply 
them, you are equally in a position to make a killing attack on your 
opponent. Why not do so?

The following method should be used: 

a) Apply the gag - turf, cloth, handkerchief, forage cap, etc. - in

ATTACKING A SENTRY 

Under "Killing a Sentry, with a knife or with hands alone", (Section 
6), the methods there described are designed exclusively for use by 
one man acting entirely on his own. Those methods remain in force and 
will continue to be taught but it is necessary now to go further and 
to teach methods of attack by two men acting as a team, providing 
thereby for conditions where this is possible and preferable. 

In making this addition to the training, two distinct sets of 
circumstances are envisaged: 

a) Merely to disarm, knock out, tie up, gag and, if necessary, 
remove a sentry out of reach of immediate discovery. It is 
extremely unlikely that one man alone could accomplish all this. 
That is why the Syllabus confines itself in this regard to the 
simpler task of killing. 

b) To disarm, kill and, if necessary, remove a sentry out of reach 
of immediate discovery. It is thought that one man alone is 
unlikely to do this as efficiently and silently as two men. 

Essentials of both a) and b) are: 


Extreme speed, 

The utmost silence. 


The first essential 
attackers as to the

the sentry's nailed 
ground. 


implies a complete understanding between the two 
part which each will play; the second refers 
avoidance of noise from a dropped rifle or from 
boots on a stone pavement, gravel or hard 


For the practice of the following methods, the student who acts as 
sentry will have on nailed boots, wear a German steel helmet and 
carry a rifle. The attackers will wear rubber shoes. The practices 
will be carried out on a stone pavement, a gravel path or on hard 
ground. 


a) When the object is not to kill . 


The "sentry", equipped as above, will take up his position, rifle 
slung over his right shoulder. The attacking team, having agreed 
upon their respective parts, will make the customary "stalk" 
approach, one immediately behind the other. The leading man will 
attack the sentry from the rear, using the fore-arm blow on the 
side of the neck and simultaneous kidney punch (left forearm and 
right fist respectively). Instantly, his left hand is transferred 
to cover the sentry's mouth and nostrils. Using his right arm to 
help, he now commences to drag the sentry backwards and downwards 
The second attacker's job, working as nearly simultaneously as 





374 SOE SYLLABUS 


possible with the first attacker, is to secure the rifle, 
administer a knock-out blow (chin-jab, punch to the jaw or solar 
plexus) and help to lower the sentry to the ground quietly. Once 
on the ground, the sentry is turned over on to his face, the 
first attacker, kneeling astride of the sentry, knees well under 
the latter's armpits, proceeds with the tying up. The second 
attacker, working opposite the first, can proceed with the 
gagging process. Once bound and gagged, the sentry is to be 
carried away a few yards, as if to put him out of reach of 
immediate observation by others. 

Repeat with the following variations: 

- Rifle slung over sentry's left shoulder. 

- Rifle carried under one arm or the other. 

- Rifle in sentry's right hand, in the "at-ease" position. 

- Repeat in the dark. 

- Aim at completing the job in two and a half minutes. 

b) When the object is to kill fusing the knife) . 

The First attacker can use the method described in Section 6, the 
second attacker being responsible for the quiet seizure of the 
rifle and for helping subsequently to carry the sentry away, 
presumably into the cover from which the attackers emerged. This 
may not aiv.ays be necessary but there is no harm done by 
practising in as complete a manner as possible so that, if the 
need really arises, everything will then be carried out with the 
minimum of fumbling, half-understood whisperings, etc. 

Alternatively, the first attacker can be responsible solely for 
seizing the sentry and keeping him quiet while the second secures 
the rifle and uses the knife (thrust in the abdominal region). 
This method appears to suit some men better than the first and 
there is no objection to their using it if they prefer. 

Repeat in daylight and in the dark, with the sentry's rifle in 
the different positions referred to under a). 

These methods are all based on the supposition that favourable 
conditions will be encountered, e.g., cover within easy reach of the 
sentry, darkness, opportunity for prior observation of the sentry's 
equipment, regularity or otherwise of his beat, etc. They teach what 
to do when within reach of a sentry but it must be pointed out to 
students that if they encounter circumstances different from those 
envisaged, it will be largely up to them to devise ways and means of 
getting within reach. Presumably, nature endowed them with some 
sense of strategy. If not, they had better not tackle this 
particular job. With this proviso, students should be encouraged to 
think out for themselves, and find means of dealing with, all sorts 
of different conditions. Such conditions, for instance, might be 
inadequate cover, two sentries instead of one (in which case two 
teams of attackers might be employed). It might be better for one 
man to try to bluff the sentry while another attacks. It might be 
impossible to attack from the rear, in which case resort might be 



SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 375 


had to the old dodge of flinging a pebble to distract his attention 
and make him face the other way. If it is at all possible, time 
should be given for working out these and other problems which are 
sure to arise. Time so spent may well mean the difference between 
success and failure in the field. 

It is reported that German Sentries have for some time been in the 
habit of carrying their rifles in such a way as to make the approved 
method of silent attack almost impossible. It would appear to be 
done as a protective measure. 

The rifle is carried as though at the "slope" on the left shoulder 
but the left hand is carried out to the left (to an angle of 
approximately 45 degrees from the front) and raised slightly. This 
means that the rifle, while resting on the top of the left shoulder 
close to the neck, crosses behind the neck, the muzzle being 
slightly behind and above the right shoulder. 

This, combined with the wearing of the German steel helmet 
effectively precludes the possibility of the forearm blow on the 
side of the neck, from either side. 

It was found, however, that while the kidney punch was delivered, it 
was possible for the attacker to cover the sentry's mouth and 
nostrils with his left hand, dragging his head backwards. 

In that position the rifle is locked between attacker and attacked 
and is in no danger of falling to the ground. Attacker No. 2 must, 
however, simultaneously catch the muzzle of the rifle with his left 
hand and press forward to prevent it striking the head of No. 1. He 
can then administer the knockout by punch to the solar plexus, but 
not chin-jab or punch to the jaw, as the latter is covered by No. 
l's left hand. 

It was found to be a benefit if No. 1 having adminstered the kidney 
punch with his right, then uses it to lock the right arm of the 
sentry, thus keeping it out of the way of No. 2 who can slip his 
left knee behind the sentry's legs. 

As the latter is dragged backwards, his feet are automatically 
levered off the ground (by No. 2's knee), making a minimum of noise. 

The only risk of noise, in this method, would appear to be the 
sentry's helmet hitting against his rifle at the moment of attack, 
but this noise must be of frequent occurrence in the course of 
walking with the rifle in this position. 

With a rifle carried in the manner described, it considerably 
complicates the silent killing of a sentry by one man. Silence is 
almost an impossibility.

WEAPON TRAINING 

INTRODUCTORY NOTES FOR INSTRUCTORS. 

It is not possible for every Instructor to be a tried Gunman. But it 
is possible to teach the Pistol successfully by acquiring a thorough 
knowledge of the principles involved and applying them in a 
practical way. The principles are based on natural body movements 
not unique to gun fighting and for that reason the instruction is 
simple, providing the imagination is used to the fullest extent to 
visualise the circumstances of Gun-fighting, to provide a 
background. Particular attention must be paid to instinctive body 
movements combined with the speed upon which depends survival. 

A large percentage of students have had previous Revolver Training 
in the old style. It is not advisable to state bluntly that the old 
method is no good as it is possible that some of them have achieved 
considerable success using the pistol as a defensive weapon or in 
competition shooting. It is better to give a proper Introduction in 
which you paint a picture of the circumstances under which they 
might be using the pistol and to show them quite clearly that the 
method you propose to teach them is the only method of firing under 
these circumstances. 

It shows a healthy interest in the subject if students are 
continually asking questions. Invariably the Instructor can give a 
satisfactory answer if he asks himself the questions "What would be 
the natural thing to do?". 

With the time and ammunition available the aim is to turn out good, 
fast, plain shots. Time spent on teaching fancy or trick shooting is 
not justified 

As with every sport, providing the principles taught are sound, 
practice makes perfect. Every endeavour should be made to build up 
the enthusiasm so that practice is carried out voluntarily. Dummy 
practice in front of a mirror is particularly beneficial and should 
be encouraged. 


Instruction in firing the Machine Carbines follows exactly the 
principles of Pistol Instruction, i.e. Tremendous speed in attack 
with sufficient accuracy to hit the vital part of a man's body. The 
conditions are the same, i.e. Killing at close quarters, demanding 
agression and extreme concentration. 

The principle of firing and manipulation of the weapon is different 
inasmuch as you are dealing with a two handed weapon having a larger 
magazine capacity and capable of full automatic fire. Automatic fire 
is of no use unless it is controlled. In the excitement and stress 





SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 377 


of close combat fighting it is difficult to fire from "Full 
Automatic" with complete control and therefore it is better to fire 
always from "single". With practice, shots are fired very fast and 
with accuracy in the same way as with the pistol. 

The most accurate position for firing a two handed weapon is from 
the shoulder because the gun is in line with the eyes and you have 
natural control of your direction. The vital factor which governs 
the position in which the gun is fired is, of course, the speed with 
which you can get into the "firing" position from the "carrying" 
position. With the Thompson the position which gives the maximum 
speed for the normal man is the "under-arm" position. This is an 
accurate firing position providing the head is down close to the 
Gun. There are few people who find the butt of the Thompson suitable 
for obtaining an equally fast shoulder position but for those it 
does suit it must be the most accurate position. 

The low hip position has been proved to be almost useless for fast 
close quarter work where you must be able to turn tremendously fast 
into position. The gun is held so low on the body and is so remote 
from the head and eyes that you can't control either your position 
or your elevation and direction. 

Because of its weight and design the Sten is an ideal gun for very 
fast shoulder work. It cam be brought into the shoulder as fast or 
faster than the hip, and, of course, it must be more accurate from 
the shoulder. 

The tendency is to compare the Sten unfavourably with the Thompson. 
This is wrong, as the Sten is really the better weapon for the type 
of work with which we are concerned, as it fires Standard 
Continental Ammunition, it is lighter, more easily concealed and has 
a much more simple mechanism than the Thompson. 

The tendency for stoppages to occur with practice Mark II weapons is 
to a certain extent exaggerated. Often these are due to bad filling 
of magazines or faulty manipulation of the Gun. 

The Hand Grenade is a very deadly close weapon under certain 
circumstances. It should be taught as such and every endeavour 
should be made to make Live Throwing practices as practical as 
possible.

or Pistol Automatic required). 

1. Proving ■ Demonstrate. 

The first thing you do when you handle any weapon is to prove to 
yourself that it is not loaded . 

To prove that an Automatic is not loaded, first remove the 
magazine. The magazine catch is situated at the base of the 
Pistol Grip. Using the thumb of the left hand, press the magazine 
catch to the rear and withdraw the magazine. Then, by grasping 
the slide with the fingers of the left hand, elbows close to the 
body, work the slide backwards and forwards two or three times by 
punching or thrusting forward with the right hand. 

The source of food (the magazine) has been removed and any round 
which might be in the breech will be ejected by the action of the 
slide. The weapon is therefore safe. 

2. Load i n g. Demonstrate. 

a) charg e t hg_.Magaz.ine- 

Hold the magazine in the palm of the left hand with the thumb 
on the assisting stud. Using the right hand, feed in the 
rounds, base first, depressing the magazine platform by means 
of the assisting stud, to receive each round. 

b) Insert the loaded magazine into the Automatic with the left 
hand, ensuring that it is locked into position by giving a 
final thrust with the thumb. 

c) Cock the action and feed the first round into the breech by 
withdrawing the slide and allowing it to spring forward. 

The weapon is now ready for firing. 

3. To Unload . Demonstrate - As for Proving. 

Note ; 

Speed in the handling and manipulation of the Automatic is 
essential. This speed is only obtained by handling the weapon 
correctly at all times. Each hand has a definite job to do. The 
right hand holds the weapon, with the forefinger inside the 
trigger guard. The left hand carries out the manipulations, i.e. 
Proving, Loading and Unloading. To assist the left hand in its 
work, the Automatic is turned over left or right to allow the 
magazine base and the slide to come naturally and easily into the 
left hand.

4. Firing . Introduction. 

Get out of your mind the idea that the Pistol is a weapon of 
self-defence. It is not. It is a weapon of attack, in just the 
same way as the rifle, the machine gun or any other combat 
weapon. 

The difference between the Pistol and these other weapons is that 
the Pistol has a short barrel; it fires blunt nosed pistol 
ammunition and is therefore a short range weapon. The normal 
combat range is not more than 12 - 15 yards. When you are 
attacking so close to the enemy you must be able to move with 
extreme speed, you must be able to kill from any position and in 
any sort of light - even in complete darkness. 

Picture in your mind the circumstances under which you might be 
using the Pistol. Take as an example a raid on an enemy occupied 
house in darkness. Firstly consider your approach. You will never 
walk boldly up to the house and stroll in as though you were 
paying a social call. On the contrary, your approach will be 
stealthy. You will be keyed up and excited, nervously alert for 
danger from whichever direction it may come. You will find 
yourself instinctively crouching; your body balanced on the balls 
of your feet in a position from which you can move swiftly in any 
direction. You make your entry into the house and start searching 
for the enemy moving along passages, perhaps up or down stairs, 
listening and feeling for any signs of danger. Suddenly, on 
turning a corner, you come face to face with the enemy. Without a 
second's hesitation you must fire and kill him before he has a 
chance to kill you. 

From this picture these facts are clear: 

a) You will always fire from the crouch position - you will never 
be in an upright position. 

b) You have no time to adopt any fancy stance when killing with 
speed. 

c) You have no time to use the sights. 

Any method of firing which does not allow for all these factors 
is useless. Gun fighting at close quarters is a question of split 
seconds. 

The best method of firing under these circumstances is by what is 
called "Instinctive Pointing". 

5. What is Instinctive Pointing . 

It is the natural way that any man points at an object when he is 
concentrating . 


As an example: stand squarely in front of a man and point at the 
exact centre of his stomach, his right or left foot or his right 








380 SOE SYLLABUS 


or left eye. You don't look down your finger and sight - you know 
you are pointing at the exact spot, instinctively. Analyse what 
you are doing. Your arm extended, with the finger pointing, comes 
into the centre of your body . In this position it is also right 
in the centre of your eyes and therefore what you are doing is to 
point straight down the centre of your line of sight. This is 
instinctive and you have natural control over your direction and 
elevation. 

Try pointing quickly from the side of the body. You will find 
that there is no instinctive control over direction. The reason 
for this is obvious. Your line of sight and your pointing line 
are remote. Any fractional variation in your pointing line 
produces a large error on an object several yards in front of 
you. 

The method we are going to use for firing the pistol is therefore 
by Instinctive Pointing, the pistol replacing the finger in 
pointing. 

6. Holding . 

The correct method of holding the Pistol is as follows: 

a) You always hold the Pistol with a tremendously strong grip. 
Grip it as though you were trying to squash the butt to pulp. 
This applies to any Pistol, large or small. 

b) The trigger finger is always kept inside the trigger guard 
with the finger nail resting against the front of the trigger 
guard. The finger is never kept running along the outside of 
the trigger guard; it reduces your speed in fast action. 

c) Try to get the thumb of your right hand running horizontally 
along the side of the Receiver, i.e. on the same plane as the 
barrel. This assists you in pointing naturally and also gives 
you lateral control of the Pistol. 

7. Firing Position - Demonstrate. 

A natural crouch position, the body balanced on the balls of the 
feet and pressed forward over the forward foot; shoulders square 
to the target. The right hand, holding the pistol, is brought 
into the centre of the body and reaches out towards the target 
until the arm is almost fully extended, in the natural pointing 
position. The barrel of the pistol is always parallel to the 
ground. In this position the right hand is turned slightly to the 
right to allow the barrel to point straight down the centre of 
the line of the sight. 

This is the Firing Position. 

It is impossible to hold the actual firing position throughout 
the approach to the enemy. It is a tense position, where every 
nerve is concentrated on killing with tremendous speed. In the 





SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 381 


approach it is necessary to adopt a more relaxed position but it 
must be possible to come from this relaxed position to the 
"Firing Position" in a fraction of a second. This relaxed 
position is known as the "Ready Position" and is adopted from the 
"Firing Position" as follows: 

Imagine there is a groove down the centre of the body. Lock the 
wrist and the elbow, then allow the arm, pivoting at the shoulder 
only, to slide down this groove until the pistol is pointing at 
the ground two or three yards in front of the body. Neither the 
wrist nor the elbow have relaxed and the downward movement from 
the shoulder is a minimum one. The return to the "Firing 
Position" is a fast, smooth movement from the shoulder. No 
adjustment of the position is necessary as the original correct 
position has been regained. 

8. Practise Squad in Proving, Loading, Unloading and in adopting the 
"Firing" and "Ready" positions. 

NOTE : Practice loading is not carried out with charged magazines. 
Practice in charging magazines is gained when student is preparing 
for firing practice. The Instructor is in the best position to 
check positional faults when standing in front of student, making 
himself the target. He must ensure that all safety precautions are 
observed and particularly that each weapon is proved. 

FIRING PRACTICES . 

PERIOD. I ■ 

The Recruit Target . 

Recruit Target - Fig. 2 (Full Figure) - Field Grey - White 
Aiming Mark on Stomach. 

Range - 3 yards. 

Purp os e, of ..Re c ruit T arget- 

It is a large target very close to the firer. You can't miss 
it and consequently it is possible to see exactly what happens 
to each round fired. The aiming mark is the object on which 
you are concentrating. If you are pointing correctly from the 
centre of your body and your elevation is 100% correct, then 
every round fired must be in the aiming mark. If you are 
pointing from the centre of your body correctly but your 
elevation is slightly wrong, then your shots will be shown 
either above or below the aiming mark and they will form a 
line up the centre of the target. This is what we are looking 
for. If your shots are shown on the left of the target it is 
because the barrel is not pointing straight down the line of 
sight. To remedy - turn the hand slightly to the right. 

If shots are shown on the right of the target it is because 
you are not firing from the centre of your body. 










382 SOE SYLLABUS 


Shots consistently low - either the barrel is not parallel to 
the ground or you are firing on the way up. 

Shots consistently high - barrel not parallel to ground. 

To kill a man it is not necessary to put a shot through his 
heart. The vulnerable part of a man's body is from his crutch 
up to the top of his head. Two fast shots anywhere into that 
area are going to dispose of him permanently. 

The object of Pistol Training is to obtain maximum speed in 
attack with sufficient accuracy to hit the vulnerable area. 

Firing Practice No. 1 . (.22) 

Recruit Target. 

Range - 3 yards. 

No. of Rounds - 6 - fired under control. 

Student charges magazine with six rounds and advances to 
Firing Point. 

On Command "Load" he loads and adopts "Ready" Position. 

Without firing, practise sliding smoothly up into the "Firing" 
Position whilst Instructor checks any fault. 

Return to "Ready" Position. 

On the Command "One" the student comes up to "Firing" 
Position, fires one round and returns to "Ready" Position. 

Repeat. 

On the Command "Two" student comes up to "Firing" Position, 
fires two rounds fast and returns to "Ready" Position. 

Repeat. 

Unload. 

Student, with Instructor, examines position of shots on 
target, discusses their position in relation to any error in 
the "Firing" position. 

Firing Practice No. 2 . (.22) 

Targets - Moving and/or bobbing targets at various ranges and 
elevation. 

No. of Rounds - 8. 

The Recruit Target represented a man standing at short range 
in front of you and it has been clearly shown how easy it is 
to control your shots into a vital part of the body providing 
you are concentrating, gripping correctly and pointing from 
the centre of your body. 





SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 383 


We are now going to fire at Moving Targets. 

Supposing you were asked to point with your finger at any 
target which appeared on the range in front of you. It would 
be ridiculous for anybody to suggest that you couldn't do so, 
with accuracy. It is going to be just as easy to point with 
the automatic, providing the correct position is adopted and 
you are concentrating intensely. There is one other thing to 
be considered and that is the correct method of turning left 
or right on the target. 

It is ridiculous to try to make rules as to how a man should 
move his feet when turning. In fast close combat fighting, 
your feet move naturally and instinctively to balance your 
body, just as a boxer moves his feet. The vital thing in 
turning is that you must get round on to your target with 
tremendous speed . How you get round doesn't matter providing 
your position when you are round is correct, i.e. body 
balanced, shoulders square to the target and your pistol 
pointing correctly from the centre of the body. 

The common fault in turning is to allow the arm to swing round 
faster than the body. With practice this tendency is easily 
cured. The arm does not move independently of the body; it 
stays in is original position in the centre of the body and is 
pulled round by the shoulders turning. 

You will always fire two fast shots at every target. The 
reason for this is as follows: 

1. You must kill your man. One shot may kill him but it is 
better to make absolutely certain by putting two shots into 
him. 

2. If a man is advancing to attack you and you put one shot 
into a vital part of his body it rarely drops him in his 
tracks immediately; his nerve system doesn't collapse for 
several seconds. On the other hand, if you put two shots in 
quick succession into him, he will drop in his tracks 
because his nerve system breaks up immediately. 

3. If you are just about to press the trigger to attack an 
opponent and you see a flash from his gun, you will 
instinctively "freeze" for a fraction of a second. Even if 
his shot misses you he will have a momentary advantage. It 
is this momentary advantage given to the man who gets the 
first shot that vou must always obtain by training yourself 
to fire two shots at tremendous speed. Even if you miss 
with your first you will get him with your second. 

Practise Squad in Turning. 

In this practice your magazine will be charged with eight 
rounds; you will fire two fast shots at each target as it 
appears. 








384 SOE SYLLABUS 


NOTE : Throughout this and every other practice, the Instructor 
observes closely every detail of body position, movement of 
the automatic and any effect on the destination of the rounds 
fired. The position of the shots on the target and the reason 
why any "misses" have occurred is discussed with the student 
and errors rectified. 


PERIOD II . ( l- 1 'i hours) 

Fir i n g P ractice .No . 3, (.22) 

Targets - Moving and/or Bobbing - at various ranges and 
elevations. 

No. of Rounds - 8. 

This practice is similar to No. 2 Practice. It is a warming up 
practice in which all that has been taught in the previous 
period is checked. Speed is again emphasised. Maximum speed 
comes from a fast, smooth movement into position and a very 
firm grip with tremendously fast trigger work. 

Fi r ing..Pra c tice N g ^. 4^. (.22) 

Targets - Moving and/or Bobbing Targets, as before. 

No. of Rounds - 8. Fired in the dark. 

You must be able to fire equally well in the dark as in the 
daylight. It is not difficult. Again, you would have no 
difficulty in pointing with your finger at a shadow in the 
dark. It is just as easy to point with the automatic. You 
must, however, be on your toes, concentrating and peering into 
the darkness so that you will be able to pick out the movement 
of your target and kill it without a moment's hesitation. 

NOTE ; The way in which this practice is carried out on the 
range will depend on the lighting facilities available. Any of 
the following methods are good. 

1. Compete darkness with a flickering dimmed light or 
alternatively, flicking the black-out curtain to admit 
flashes of light. 

2. Complete darkness with the rays of a dimmed torch moving 
quickly backwards and forwards over the range area. 

3. Using night glasses. 

Firing Practice No. 5 . (.22) 

Targets - Moving and/or Bobbing Targets, as before. 

No. of Rounds - 8. 

In previous practices firing has taken place from a definite 
Firing Point. In actual combat you will invariably be moving in 







SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 385 


to the attack. In practising movement, the important thing to 
remember is that however fast you are moving when you are 
actually killing the target, you must be in the 100% correct 
"Firing Position", body crouched and balanced, automatic pointing 
correctly down the line of sight and every nerve concentrated on 
forcing your shots deep into the belly of the target. 

Imagine the range is a beer cellar containing a number of 
Germans. You are outside with your automatic loaded and you 
are going to burst in and kill them ruthlessly. 

In the old-style shooting, an attack of this nature involved 
slow, stealthy movement, relying entirely on the enemy not 
hearing or seeing anything until the entry had actually been 
made. This is an impractical and dangerous method when you are 
dealing with an alert enemy. 

The following is the better method as it involves that shock 
of surprise which freezes into immobility even the most 
dangerous individual for a few seconds:- 

You have reached the doorway of the cellar by a stealthy 
approach, making no sound whatever. Your automatic is loaded 
and cocked. Very quietly turn the handle of the door as far as 
it will go and then, preparing yourself for the effort, you 
kick the door open and burst into the room with maximum speed 
and noise and kill your targets before they have a chance to 
realise what has happened. 

NOTE : The old-style and the new methods are demonstrated by 
the Instructor, showing particularly how the body retains the 
balanced crouched position and the correct Firing Position 
irrespective of the movement of the feet. Also emphasise how 
the loaded automatic is held in the "Ready" position before 
and during the entry into the cellar. 

Magazines are charged with eight rounds - two rounds to be 
fired at each target. 

In the supervision of the firing the Instructor forces the 
speed of the student in every way possible. 

If a student is wild in his movements and loses position 
altogether, then a slower controlled practice attack should be 
made which can be speeded up as progress is made. 

PERIOD III . 

Firing Practice No. 6 . (.32 Colt) 

Targets - Moving and/or Bobbing as before. 

No. of Rounds - 6. 

The manipulation of the .32 Colt is the same as the .22 
Hi-Standard, except that the magazine has not an assisting 




386 SOE SYLLABUS 


stud. The thumb of the left hand assists in the feeding of the 
rounds into the magazine by depressing the top round to 
facilitate the entry of the next round. 

If you fire one Pistol you can fire any Automatic or Revolver, 
whether British, American or Foreign. The important thing to 
remember is that the barrel of your pistol is always parallel 
to the around in the normal position. 

Before firing a strange automatic always test your position. 
Get the feel of the weapon, adopt the Firing position, bring 
the barrel parallel to the ground and lock your wrist so that 
when you move into the "Ready" position and return to the 
"Firing" position it is still parallel. 

Magazine charged with six rounds. Two shots to be fired at 
each target. 

NOTE : Instructors should again emphasise the tremendously 
firm grip. When firing the .22 slight relaxing of the grip has 
probably not taken a shot off the target, with heavier calibre 
weapons the effect of relaxing the grip is greater and shots 
will not be "on". 

Continue to build up agression in attack. Aggression denotes 
complete concentration, which is so vital in practice. It also 
encourages the state of mind which would exist in actual 
combat. 

Firing Practice Np. 7 . (.32 Colt)

No. of Rounds - 6. 

So far we have been dealing with the normal firing position 
for close combat. There is the occasion, however, when it is 
necessary to take a long range shot. Firstly . the prone 
position: this gives you an ideal firing position and at the 
same time makes you a very difficult target to hit. 









SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 387 


Demonstrate . 

Lie down square to the target, right hand grasping the pistol, 
left hand gripping the right fist, thumb forward and clear of 
the recoiling slide; elbows on the ground and well apart; head 
well back from the sights. 

Secondly . the long range firing position in the open. A 
position which can be adopted very quickly from the normal 
position. 

Demonstrate . 

Feet astride, body balanced and square to the target. Right 
hand, grasping the pistol, thrust straight out in front of the 
body. The left hand grips the right fist, thumb clear of the 
recoiling slide, and pulls back slightly against the fully 
extended right arm. In this position the pistol is in the 
centre of the body and held as though in a vice. 

Thirdly . the long range firing position from behind cover. 
Utilising a lamp-post, a tree, the side of a house, the 
doorway of a house, in fact anything providing cover which 
presents a high support which will bear your weight. In this 
position you have an ideal firing position with maximum cover 
for the vital parts of your body. 

Demonstrate ■ 

Using a convenient tree, placing the left toe and left knee 
against the cover, right foot extended well to the rear until 
the right leg is straight and rigid. The ball of the thumb of 
the right hand rests against the right hand side of the cover, 
left hand grasping the right wrist, back of the hand 
downwards. The body is now supported at all points and lined- 
up behind the cover to give maximum protection. The pistol 
must be gripped very firmly and not canted over to the right. 

Practise squad. 

Magazine charged 6 rounds. Two aimed or rough aimed shots to 
be fired from the prone position. Rising quickly, adopt long 
range standing position in the open and fire two more shots. 
Then move quickly to a suitable tree and fire the last two 
shots from the Firing position behind cover. 

NOTE : It should be emphasised that these positions will be 
adopted quickly. Use of the sights is permissible but there 
will not always be time to use them and necessity for quick 
rough aiming should be explained and practised. 

Firing Practice No. 9 . (.22) 

Target - "Gallows" Target approx. 20 feet from ground. (See 
Appendix "A".) 









388 SOE SYLLABUS 


Range from Tree - 8-10 yards. 

No. of Rounds - 6. 

The difficulty when firing "up" is to control your elevation. 
Generally you find that your shots are striking either above 
or below the target. The reason for this is because the arm 
and the body are elevating quickly and unless the movement of 
each is 100% correct the aim is not correct. 

Demonstrate . 

It is better to elevate the pistol by a movement of the body 
only which can be easily controlled with practice. At the same 
time as the body is elevating by bending back from the waist 
over the rear leg, the right arm is extended straight out. 

It is impossible to fire in this way when you are right 
underneath the target, as, for example, if you were suddenly 
attacked from the top of a flight of stairs as you were going 
up. Under these circumstances the fastest and best method of 
dealing with the target is to thrust the right arm out towards 
the target just as though you were trying to thrust the muzzle 
into his stomach. 

Practise Squad. 

Magazine charged 6 rounds. 

Adopt the normal firing position as though engaging a target 
on you own level underneath the "Gallows" target. On the 
command "Up" engage the "Gallows" target, firing two shots, 
and return to the normal position. Repeat. On the command 
"Advance" move quickly in the direction of the target; when 
you are almost underneath you will get the command "Up". Like 
a flash you must come up and fire two shots in the method you 
have been taught, arm straight as though you were thrusting 
the muzzle into the stomach of the target. 

PERIOD V . 

Firing Practice No. 10 . - Outdoors. (.22) 

Target - Fig. 3. 

Range - From a platform between two trees 20 - 25 feet from 

the ground, or from a suitable cliff or similar ground 
where the target can be placed almost immediately 
below the firer. 

Demonstrate . 

Firing Down . As with firing "up" the difficulty is to control 
elevation when firing from the normal position. In addition, 
to see your target when firing down, it is necessary to expose 
a large part of your body. The best method under these 
circumstances is to stand sideways, stretch the right arm out 







SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 389 


to the fullest extent in the direction of the target. The 
automatic is held as though it was an extension of the right 
arm, so that by turning your hand and looking straight down 
your arm the sights are lined on to the target. 

You will find that it is possible to stand several feet away 
from the edge of the platform so that you are almost invisible 
to the person at whom you are firing. 

This is the best method of sniping at a person below from the 
room of a house. If the window sill is high, you can stand on 
a table or a box several feet away from the window and you are 
getting maximum concealment. Also the flash and smoke from the 
discharge of your pistol is absorbed in the room, making the 
source of the shooting very difficult to trace unless it is 
observed at the exact moment of firing. 

Magazine charged with 6 rounds. 

NOTE : Before firing, the Instructor should demonstrate the 
extent of the concealment offered by this firing position. 
Students grouped underneath the platform, Instructor mounts 
the platform and adopts the correct position, aiming as though 
to fire into chest of each student in turn. 

Firing Practice No. 11 . - Outdoors. (.32 Colt) 

Targets - Three full-figure and two hand and shoulders. 

Range - Maximum 35 yards. 

No. of Rounds - 6. 

At tac k in the Open - 

The object of this practice is to develop speed in closing to 
attack the enemy. 

The targets are in view from a distance of approximately 35 
yards. 

Magazine is loaded with 6 rounds. 

The student advances two or three yards, adopts the prone 
position and fires one round at a full figure target: he then 
rises quickly runs to 20 yards, deals with another full figure 
target, from the standing long range position. Then, without 
hesitation, he moves very fast to close quarters and deals 
with the remaining two targets from the normal firing 
position. 

NOTE ; Speed in attack, shooting and adoption of Firing 
position must be emphasised throughout. 

The sequence of this practice can of course be varied to suit 
the ground. If possible, the starting point should be in a 
position where the student can advance to cover for his first 





390 SOE SYLLABUS 


shot. The close quarter targets should be wide apart to give 
maximum right and left turn. 

Firing Practice No. 12 . - Outdoors. (.32 colt) 

Targets - As for Practice No. 11. 

No. of rounds - 6. 

This practice is a repetition of Firing Practice No. 11. 

PERIOD VI . 

Firing. .Pra ctic e N o. 13- - Outdoors. (.32 Colt) 

Stalk Course - 6 Targets - No. of Rounds 14. 

NOTE : The object of the Stalk Course is to provide targets at 
distances which would be involved in actual combat so that the 
student is forced to decide, immediately, the correct position 
for dealing with the target. The targets should also be on 
different levels. 

In order to obtain the maximum benefit from the course, an 
endeavour should be made to present practical problems which 
will emphasise the principles already stressed throughout the 
pistol course. If the student deals with the situation 
presented satisfactorily, his successes will increase his 
confidence in his ability to overcome other situations. It 
will teach him to expect them and to find an immediate remedy. 

The student who is "caught-out" or who does the wrong thing is 
shown what he should have done and why. He, also, will have an 
idea of what to expect and is encouraged to improve his 
ability. 

In proceeding round the course the student will use his 
knowledge of Fieldcraft. He will have been previously taught 
the correct method of stalking in a preliminary practice under 
the Fieldcraft Syllabus. 

There is a tendency to make the Stalk Course a test of 
Fieldcraft, where, if the student's powers of observation are 
not acute, he proceeds round the course without firing a shot. 
This is not the intention. The Stalk Course is a shooting 
practice where all the emphasis on speed in attack, control of 
position in wide fast turns, the necessity for alternative 
positions to deal with middle distance and awkward targets, is 
shown in a practical way. If necessary, he should be 
"frightened" on to a target which hasn't been seen so that he 
reacts almost without thinking. He must be forced to move fast 
in killing a target and prevented from deliberate aiming. 

In the past, a system of scoring was used, where "hits" on the 
target received so many points. This is of no use in training 
as it encourages a man to aim deliberately so that he can 
return a good score. 





SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 391 


The targets should be painted to represent Germans. A simple 
standard design, not involving the services of an artist, is 
easily obtained and is most practical from a maintenance point 
of view. After dealing with the first target, the student will 
know what he is looking for, as he would if he was actually 
dealing with a German in uniform. 

When the students are grouped in the "Waiting Bay" before 
commencing the course, the object of the practice should be 
fully explained. It creates interest if a story is evolved 
around the course with particular emphasis on the imagination 
being used. They are not shooting at targets but at Germans, 
who are armed and lying in wait for them. They must kill the 
enemy before he has a chance to kill them. 

Two Magazines charged with seven rounds in each. Two shots to 
be fired at each target. Reload with fresh magazine after 
disposing of three targets. Care must be taken when reloading; 
there is one round still in the breech. Remove empty magazine, 
insert full one and carry on. After dealing with the sixth 
target - unload, removing magazine and ejecting the round 
remaining in breech. When reloading you must get behind cover. 
For a few seconds you are virtually unarmed. The enemy will 
take advantage of this if you let him. 

After completion of course Instructor discusses with student 
his performance, particularly the way in which he has attacked 
the targets and definite Fieldcraft errors which would have 
been fatal in actual combat. 

PERIOD VII, 

The balance of 10 Rounds with the .32 Colt is intended to be 
used on the Street Fighting course. Where this course is not 
available an additional indoor practice at moving targets 
should be given or, if time is available, an additional 
"Stalk". 

NOTE : It is proposed to construct an outside Firing Bay in 
close proximity to all Ranges. The object of this Firing Bay 
is to cut out the "waiting" period whilst the principal Firing 
practices are being carried out. After a student has fired a 
practice he will fire a further practice with a .22 under 
another Instructor. He will then return to the original range. 
The Firing practices at the Firing Bay will be based on the 
practices being fired on the Main Range as shown on the 
appended list of Practices. In addition, drawing and firing 
from a shoulder holster will be incorporated. 

Firing Bay . 

It should be built in a 'safe' place as close as possible to 
the Main Range. All that is required is a back butt of banked 
turf or sleepers with side wings about 5 yards long 
constructed of sandbags or turf extending left and right. 






392 SOE SYLLABUS 


Targets should be moving or bobbing but if this is not 
practical stationary targets will serve the purpose. 

The method of carrying out a practice with Stationary Targets 
is as follows:- 

The targets, head and shoulders and full length, are placed in 
positions giving as wide a turn left and right as possible. 
They are numbered from the left, in the presence of the 
student, either by actually marking the targets or by word of 
mouth. The targets are engaged on the word of command given by 
the Instructor. For example, on the command "Two" the student 
attacks No. 2 Target, firing two fast shots. The command 
"Four" follows immediately, he engages No. 4 Target, and so 
on. Whilst this method is not so efficient as a practice with 
moving or bobbing targets, it does make the student get "on 
his toes" waiting for the word of command. Another advantage 
is that the targets can be moved to any position. 

In "movement" practices, to make the student familiar with a 
complete turn, he should be made to stand with his back to the 
target, charged magazine in the automatic, but not cocked. The 
Instructor engages him in conversation, trying to take his 
attention away from the targets. In the middle of conversation 
suddenly scare the student on to the targets so that he has to 
turn, cock and engage the targets in one movement. This is 
also a good practice for shoulder-holster training. 

The battle-dress blouse does not allow for the proper use of 
the shoulder-holster, as it is designed for civilian clothes. 
In practice it should be worn with the jacket off or over the 
battle-dress blouse. 

The use of Screens . 

This is an innovation, contrived by a well known B.O. 
Instructor, and enables the range to be converted quickly into 
an alley-way where fast turns and surprise targets are easily 
arranged. The principle is very simple. Posts are erected at a 
distance of four or five yards apart on each side of the range 
up to the firing point. Wires are stretched from post to post 
across the range on which are hung screens made of split sand 
bags extending to the ground. By staggering these screens it 
is possible to form a corridor down which the student attacks. 
Targets are placed in any surprise position and the student 
can also be made to surmount obstacles on his way through. 

This is the most obvious use of the screens but they can also 
be arranged to form the walls of a room and by incorporating a 
door frame on two supports you can include practices involving 
an attack into a room.

There are a number of interesting points regarding care of 
weapons and Gun Fighting generally which can be incorporated 
in a short lecture towards the end of the course. 

uport hod oy Lub ric ant s. 

Automatic weapons with fast moving mechanism and bearing 
surfaces must be kept slightly oiled to avoid overheating and 
seizing. It is more than possible that rifle oil will not be 
available to students on operations. In an emergency the 
following can be used to oil or grease the weapon: 

1. Bacon Fat. 

2. Tallow - Candles. 

3. Graphite - Pencil Lead. 

Holding-up . 

Normally, when you are attacking into a room you will 
immediately kill everybody in it. There is the occasion 
however when for one reason or another you wish to hold the 
people under the threat of your gun whilst another member of 
the raiding party is perhaps obtaining rope to tie them up or 
the leader of party to interrogate them before they are 
disposed of. 

The normal firing position is a tense position which cannot be 
held for long without fatigue and consequent relaxing of 
vigilance. The best way of holding up is to relax from the 
normal position until the feet are comfortably astride, at the 
same time bringing the pistol back until it is held in the 
centre of the body, barrel parallel to the ground with the 
elbow resting on the right hip. Then, herd the enemy into the 
far comer of the room on the same side as the door and then 
back away until you are against the wall opposite the door. In 
this position you are relaxed and at the same time you can 
turn your gun on to anybody who makes a move, simply by 
turning the body until it is square to the target. Also, in 








394 SOE SYLLABUS 


this position you can't be surprised from the rear and you 
have the door in sight all the time. 

Attack into a Room against Armed Opposition . 

This is the occasion when the enemy is cornered in a room and 
has locked or barricaded the door. He is also armed. Assuming 
some of your party are armed with Stens, then two of them take 
up a position where they can crossfire through the door into 
opposite corners of the room. You blow the lock off and force 
the door open, working from the ground, underneath their 
crossfire. When the door is open make your way in on your 
stomach, engaging targets as they appear. When you are in the 
room, the Sten gunners maintaining their fire follow you in, 
at the same time spreading their fire round to the main part 
of the room. 

In theory, perhaps faults can be found with this technique but 
it gives you an idea how weapons can be co-ordinated in an 
attack of this nature. 

Escape Hints . 

If you are cornered in a room with the enemy forcing an entry 
and you are armed, it is fatal to stay on floor level. As the 
enemy burst into the room, their gaze and fire will 
immediately sweep the floor level before they give their 
attention to any higher level. If you can get on top of a 
piano or pile of boxes, as high as possible on the same side 
of the room as the door, you stand a chance of escaping notice 
for a few seconds, which will enable you to concentrate 
accurate fire at the point where it is most likely to break up 
the attack. 

The enemy have cornered you in a room and are forcing the door 
in. An old ruse was to get behind the door. As the enemy 
rushed in you were able to take them from the rear if you were 
armed, or dodge round the door if you were unarmed. This 
method is more or less worn out now, as police and other 
agents are often trained to fire through and behind the door 
as they are rushing in, to prevent anybody surprising them 
from that direction. A better and more effective ruse is to 
stand on the other side of the door where it opens. Get as 
close to the wall as possible. As the door is forced and the 
enemy rushes in, the force of their rush will carry them right 
past you and all you have to do is to slip out. 

Firing in the Dark . 

When firing in the dark never stay in the position from which 
you fired. The enemy will fire at the flash of your gun. If 
you are in the prone position "fire" and roll away to the 
side. Keep on doing this, never stay still . 


General . 








SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 395 


The methods you have been taught during this course have been 
proved to be the best methods in Gun Fighting. But it is 
impossible to give a ready-made solution to every problem 
which is likely to arise. With your knowledge of Gun Fighting 
you must use your initiative and, if necessary, vary a general 
practice to suit a particular situation. 

As an example: You have been taught always to fire two shots 
into a man when you wish to kill. The reasons for this have 
been explained and are sound, but there is the occasion when 
you cannot afford to put two shots into a man. If you dive 
into a room with seven rounds in your magazine and there are 
five people to kill, obviously you can't give them all two 
rounds each without changing a magazine. You wouldn't have 
time for this and you would necessarily have to fire one shot 
at each man, keeping two to finish them off. 

Remember, also, as soon as you have finished firing, before 
you do anything else, clear your gun and insert a fresh 
magazine. 

You have been taught to ignore the safety catch on the 
automatic, always carrying a loaded magazine in it but with 
the action not cocked, so that you draw, cock and fire in one 
movement. The reasons for this are also sound, but again there 
is the occasion when to meet particular circumstances it would 
be better to have the action cocked with the safety catch 
applied. Again, you must use your initiative. 


Always take great care of your magazines. If the magazine is 
distorted or treated badly the automatic will not function. 

Never store your magazines fully loaded. When the spring is 
under full compression for any length of time it becomes weak. 

NOTES FOR INSTRUCTORS ON PISTOL TRAINING 

Introducing the Weapons and the Principles of Firing t h em 

Instinctively . 

1. It must be left to the discretion of the Instructor whether the 
instruction in the weapons themselves, i.e. stripping, loading, 
unloading, etc. is carried out at the same time as the 
introduction to instinctive firing, or whether the introduction 
to the weapons and their mechanisms is done first and separately, 

An advantage of giving, say, half-an-hour's instruction on the 
weapons themselves is that the student is familiar with the 
working parts of the weapon when he first attempts to practice 
instinctive firing positions, and the instructor is free to 
concentrate upon these only, and the students will know by that 
time all such points as correct handling of the pistol while 
cocking, loading, unloading, etc. 







396 SOE SYLLABUS 


2. The principles of instinctive firing should always be introduced 
in the form of a short talk - either in a lecture-room or in the 
range. This talk should draw a picture of a man entering an 
enemy-occupied house or some similar circumstance, and should 
point out which of the actions involved in our methods are 
instinctive . The more amusing and the more dramatic this talk the 
greater its value, but the instructor must always ensure that 
while the weapon is in his hand he is practising what he teaches. 

Practising the Student in Instinctive Firing Positions . 

1. The student will naturally be required to practise the position 
before firing at the recruit target, and the instructor must make 
certain that the student has a grasp of what is required before 
he begins to fire. The instinct of many instructors is to put the 
student into position by hand. This should be avoided - let him 
do it himself by verbal instruction and repeated demonstration. 
Here again, the instructor must make certain that his own 
position is correct. The only handling of the student which may 
be necessary is that of the hand holding the pistol and of the 
left shoulder if the student shows a tendency to let it drop 
back. 

2. At all costs guard against keeping the student in an 
uncomfortable position while his mistakes are being corrected 
verbally. Before the student is accustomed to it, the "ready" 
position is very uncomfortable if prolonged for more than a 
minute or so. Therefore always allow the student to rest if you 
have much talking to do. 

3. It is unnecessary to dance round the student searching for 
mistakes. In the early stages of instruction always get in front 
of the student, and see him from the "target's eye" point of view. 

4. The instructor should have a certain definite sequence in which 
he looks at a student whenever he has a weapon in his hands - 
just as an officer is taught to have a sequence when inspecting 
troops. Each instructor may have his own individual sequence 
which suits him best - but see that nothing is missed. Feet 
(balanced position), body (Crouch and shoulders square), firing 
arm (whether too bent or too straight), wrist (whether correct 
amount of cocking and correction and whether remaining rigid when 
the arm is moved), other arm (whether resting heavily upon the 
knee and thus making it difficult to turn the upper half of the 
body), hand (whether in the centre of the body and whether 
fingers and thumb in correct position) - is a specimen sequence. 

Early Firing Practices . 

1. Do not let a student fire while making an obvious error in 

position - unless you wish to prove to him that this particular 
error causes a certain inaccuracy. With the small amount of 
ammunition at disposal, every shot fired incorrectly is a waste. 
Therefore, if you see some fault when the student is in the 
"ready" position, correct if before he begins to fire. Do not be 






SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 397 


afraid to stop the practice in order to correct a fault at once - 
but correct the fault quickly and do not go into a lengthy 
discussion. Every time a fault is made it becomes more difficult 
to eradicate. 

2. When the student is firing, always stand on his right (unless he 
is left-handed) and slightly to the rear. Don't crowd him, and on 
no account shout in his ear - this is a common fault which 
flusters a nervous student. 

3. ALWAYS WATCH THE STUDENT AND NOT THE TARGET AT THE MOMENT OF 
FIRING. By watching the student the instructor should be able to 
tell automatically where the shots have gone. If, instead, the 
instructor watches the target and it is missed, he is not in a 
position to tell the student the reason.

1. Wrist turned too much up. 

2. Pistol comes up too high. 

3. Jerking from "ready" position to firing position - movement 
should be smooth and fast. 

4. Jerking the body back, or raising the body as the pistol hand 
comes up.

3. Feet off balance, causing staggering. 

4. Hand not kept in centre of body. 

5. A different hand elevation is reached each time. 








398 SOE SYLLABUS 


6. The pistol is "punched" towards the target with a movement of the 
elbow. 

7. Pistol arm not straight enough - the arm should be almost fully 
extended, so that the bend is only just perceptible. 

If a student shows an error which cannot be immediately traced to 
its cause, the points under the above analyses should be 
eliminated one by one until the instructor is certain of the 
reason. 

Faults in Firing at Moving Targets, and at Targets in Varying 

Directions . 

1. When changing direction from one target to another, the whole of 
the upper half of the body must be turned squarely to face the 
new target. In the majority of cases this requires a slight 
alteration in the position of the feet. This alteration should be 
a smooth natural action - "jumping" round should be discouraged 
at all costs. 

2. Both the footwork and the movement of the upper half of the body 
are seriously handicapped when the left hand is rested heavily 
upon the knee, as this is tending to lock the body in the 
direction in which it was originally facing. 

3. Most students feel that it is necessary to "aim off" a moving 
target. At instinctive firing ranges this is entirely unnecessary 
and will cause a miss in front of the target. The pistol should 
be pointed at the centre of the target as if it were stationary. 

4. A miss is also almost certain if the pistol is pointed in front 
of the target and the firer waits to pull the trigger until the 
target has reached that point. Apart from other considerations, a 
live target might change direction and never reach that point. 

Fa ul t? in Handling . 

Magazines should be inserted with the fingers and thrust home 
with the thumb - it should not be banged into place with the base 
of the hand. 

General . 

1. Unteachables do exist, but they are one in a thousand. An 
instructor should never allow a student to leave his school as a 
bad shot - his life will probably depend upon how well he has 
been taught this subject. If the student is getting consistently 
bad results, first ascertain whether his fault is consistently in 
one direction. Then go through in your mind the errors causing 
that deviation, and eliminate them one by one until the cause is 
determined. 

2. Upon the atmosphere which an instructor creates in his teaching 
of this subject will largely depend the amount of interest which 
a student will take in it. If an instructor is not himself 






SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 399 


aggressive, he cannot expect his students to show aggression. If 
he himself is obviously not interested in the subject, he cannot 
expect his students to be keyed up to the desirable pitch. An 
instructor should try to create in the student's mind the 
impression that he is actually "killing" the targets, and should 
force him to shoot as though his life depended upon it. 

3. An instructor should try to dispel the atmosphere of "Range 

Practices" where it is incumbent upon every man to try to get a 
good score, and should impress upon the students that during 
instruction it is the application of fast, instinctive methods 
that matters, and not the number of hits upon the target achieved 
by slower or less practical methods. 


APPENDIX,."^ 


MACHINE CARBINE COURSE 

P E RIO D .I. A. In t roduction t ffi, Tho m pso n .S ub-Ma ch ine Gun . 

Stores : Thompson Sub-Machine Gun. 2 Magazines. 

A. 1. INTRODUCTION . 

The Gun is known as the Thompson Sub-Machine Gun. Calibre .45. 
Rate of fire - 700 Rounds per minute and it weighs 
approximately 10 lbs. 

There are two types of magazine: The Drum type holding 50 
Rounds and the Box type holding 20 Rounds. You can forget 
about the Drum type. This is of no use for fast close combat 
work for the following reasons: 

a) It is too heavy. 

b) It is difficult to fill quickly and filling is noisy. 

c) The magazines are an awkward shape, making them difficult 
to carry without some special carrier. 

d) Attachment to the gun is insecure. 

The box type of magazine is ideally suited for our purpose. It 
is light, easily filled and can be conveniently carried in the 
pockets or inside the blouse. You can carry eight or nine 
filled magazines distributed in your clothing without being 
inconvenienced in any way. 

2. MAGAZINE FILLING . 

To fill or charge the magazine, grasp it in the left hand with 
the ribbed side at the base of the fingers. Assisting with the 
thumb of the left hand, feed in the rounds with the right hand 
by pressing the base of the round on the magazine platform and 
thrusting downwards and forwards. 










400 SOE SYLLABUS 


3. CHARACTERISTICS . 

The "Tommy Gun" has a short barrel and fires blunt nosed 
pistol ammunition. It is therefore a short range weapon &amp; by 
reason of the heavy calibre of the bullets and the high rate 
of fire it is a valuable weapon for any type of close combat 
fighting, such as Street and House Fighting, etc. 

It is fired, from the hip up to a distance of 12 yards; from 
the shoulder standing up to 50 yards; the maximum effective 
range of the Gun is 175 yards fired from the shoulder in the 
prone position. 

4. MANIP U LATION . Demonstrate. 

Proving : As you have been taught, the first thing you do with 
any weapon is to prove to yourself that it is not loaded. To 
'prove' the Tommy Gun, firstly turn the Gun over on to its 
right-hand side and grasp the magazine with the fingers of the 
left hand. Then place the thumb of the left hand on the 
magazine catch, press upwards and withdraw the magazine. Turn 
the gun upright. Grasp the knob of the cocking handle with the 
fingers of the left hand and work the bolt backwards and 
forwards two or three times, keeping the trigger pressed 
throughout. Leave the knob of the cocking handle in the 
forward position. The gun is now "safe". 

To Load : Hold the gun at the "carry", i.e. gun under the arm, 
right hand grasping the rear claw grip, muzzle pointing to the 
ground directly forward, at an angle of about 45 degrees. 

See that the bolt is forward or, in other words, that the 
breech is closed. 

Turn the gun over to the right, so that its left side is 
uppermost, and verify the positions of the change and safety 
levers. The former must be at "single-shot" and the latter in 
the firing position. If they are not in these positions, they 
are to be altered at once, without waiting for orders. The 
bolt must be pulled back until it locks before the alterations 
can be effected. The alterations effected, ease the bolt 
forward until the breech is closed again. 

Left side of the gun still uppermost, lay the right forefinger 
along the right-hand side of the trigger guard. Take a 20-shot 
magazine in the left hand and using as a guide the tip of the 
right forefinger, which should protrude a little beyond the 
trigger guard, enter the magazine in its grooves and send it 
smartly home. Invariably . pull down on the magazine (with the 
left hand) to ensure that it is locked in position. 

Turn the gun into the upright position. As there is nothing in 
the breech, the gun is perfectly safe and may be carried for 
an indefinite period without risk. 

Note that in all the operations described so far, the gun 







SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 401 


muzzle remains pointed at an angle of 45 degrees, at the 
ground directly to the front. To prepare for firing, draw the 
bolt back until it locks. 

Unloading : On the cessation of firing, magazine wholly or 
partially exhausted, the bolt remains in the rearward or 
firing position. If firing is not to be resumed, remove 
magazine and ease the bolt forward. Work it back and forth two 
or three times and leave in the forward, or closed, position. 

If the magazine is exhausted and it is desired to resume 
firing at once, remove the empty magazine and insert a filled 
one. The bolt being in the rear, or firing, position, firing 
can be resumed instantly. 

Note ; All operations described under Manipulation must be 
practised until they can be performed, in daylight or in the 
dark, smartly and without the slightest suspicion of fumbling. 
Instructors should show how to verify by touch, in the dark, 
the positions of the bolt, change-lever and safety-catch. 
Students should be shown and practised in the charging and 
uncharging of magazines. They should be informed also that 
while it is possible to put 21 rounds in a magazine intended 
for 20, a magazine so charged will sometimes not lock in 
position when inserted in the gun. Their attention should be 
drawn, therefore, to the necessity, before going into action, 
of testing each charged magazine in the gun to make absolutely 
sure that it will lock in position. If it is not noticed, as 
might be the case in a hurry, that the magazine is not locked, 
either it will drop out or the bolt will fail to take the 
cartridges into the breech. 

5. THE FIRING POSITION . Demonstrate. 

The 'Low Hip' P osition- 

A natural crouched position of the body, left foot forward. 
From the "Carry" position the gun is raised until the barrel 
is parallel to the ground, the butt pressed into and held in 
the hip by the right arm. The left hand grasps the foregrip, 
all the fingers engaged in the grooves provided, thumb to the 
rear; the left elbow is now brought inwards until it is locked 
in position, as far underneath the gun as possible. The body 
is then over the gun with the head well down in an aggressive 
attacking position. This position is known as the "Low Hip" 
position. It is not a satisfactory position for fast close 
combat work as it has been proved that you cannot maintain the 
forward elevation of the gun when turning tremendously fast on 
to a target. It is also such a low position that it is very 
difficult to deal effectively and quickly with high targets. 

The 'Under Arm' Position . 

The position of the body is the same as with the 'Low Hip' 
position. The gun, instead of being held into the hip, is held 
underneath the arm, left hand grasping the foregrip, left 









402 SOE SYLLABUS 


elbow underneath the gun barrel parallel to the ground. Head 
in an aggressive position close to the gun. In this position 
the gun is much higher in the body so that the left elbow can 
easily "lock" under the gun. This enables you to maintain the 
forward elevation of the gun when turning fast on to a target. 
The head and eyes are much closer to the gun and you have 
naturally more control over your direction and elevation. 

In the approach to the target the butt can be held "ready" 
underneath the arm, with barrel pointing towards the ground at 
an angle of 30 degrees, left hand grasping the foregrip. To go 
into "Action" all you have to do is to "snap" the barrel up 
until it is directed at the target, at the same time bringing 
the head down to the gun. Alternatively, if the butt 
permanently under the arm is an uncomfortable position to 
carry the gun, the gun can be held in the most comfortable 
two-handed position and "snapped" into position when "action" 
is required. This requires practice. The left elbow and right 
arm "lock" the gun simultaneously. 

Ihe_5hQuldg£_Po§.ition ■ 

In this position the gun is used exactly as you would use a 
shot-gun. As the gun is brought into the shoulder the body is 
pressed forward towards the target. It is not fired from the 
upright position. 

This position is ideal for the man who is used to a shot-gun 
or the man with very long arms. With practice the gun can be 
brought into the shoulder very fast and as the gun is in line 
with the eyes, it is the most accurate position. For a frontal 
shot it is slightly slower than the hip position but, with 
practice, it is just as fast when turning on to a target. 

A variation of this method which allows the man with short 
arms to use the gun from the shoulder quickly, for close 
quarter targets, is as follows: 

Butt in the shoulder, left hand grasping the foregrip, barrel 
pointing to the ground in front at an angle of 30 degrees, 
left foot forward. To fire, raise the gun into the shoulder 
until it is pointing at the target. This is a very quick and 
accurate snap shooting method and if need to the sights can be 
used conveniently. Its one disadvantage is that it is an 
uncomfortable way of carrying the gun for any length of time. 

Note : Having demonstrated the various firing positions, the 
Instructor should assist the students in choosing the position 
which suits them best. All the positions should be practised but 
the low hip position should be discouraged as it has been proved 
to be an impractical position. It should be pointed out to those 
students who choose the Under Arm position that in normal combat 
they must be able to combine this position with a fast shoulder 
position to deal with targets at over 12 yards distance.

The Recruit Target - Fig. 2 (Full figure) Field Grey - white

No. of Rounds fired - 10 

The Purpose of the Recruit Target . 

The target is at close range so that you can't miss it. You 
will see exactly what happens to every shot fired and you 
should endeavour to control all your shots on to the aiming 
mark. The gun is not moved independently of the body. In the 
correct position it is locked, so that you depress your body 
to depress your shots. Similarly, when you wish to elevate, 
you ease your body slightly back. Shots right or left of the 
aiming mark are corrected by pressing inwards slightly with 
the left or right shoulder. 

Student charges magazine with ten rounds and advances to 
Firing Point. On command "Load" he loads and adopts the 
"Ready" position. (Gun muzzle at 45 degrees to ground). 

Without firing, practise coming quickly into the Firing 
Position whilst the Instructor checks faults. On command "One" 
come quickly into the "Firing" position, fire one shot without 
hesitating and return to the "Ready" position. 

Note : This repeated until six shots have been fired. 

On the command "Two" come quickly into position and fire a 
burst of two rounds and return to the "Ready" position. 

Repeat. 

Student, with Instructor, examines position of shots on the 
target and discusses their position in relation to any error 
in the "Firing" position. 

Note : Concentration on the aiming mark should be emphasised as 
the principal aid to instinctive firing. Any attempt to aim 
must be discouraged immediately.

In this practice we are going to fire at Moving or Bobbing 
Targets. It is not difficult to hit them providing you are 
concentrating, adopting the correct position with the left 
elbow well under the gun, the head down and the body pressed 








404 SOE SYLLABUS 


in towards the target in an aggressive attacking position. 

In turning on to the targets, the gun does not move 
independently of the body. It is brought on to the target by 
the body and feet moving. The feet move naturally to balance 
the body and the principal point is that you must get round on 
to your target with tremendous speed and when you are round 
your "Firing Position" must be correct. 

Note : Jumping round is a poor substitute for neat, precise 
footwork and instructors should not permit it. 

Magazine charged with five rounds. One shot to be fired at 
each target as it is exposed. 

Note : Throughout the practice the Instructor observes closely 
every detail of the student's actions in attacking the target 
so that he will know the reason why 'misses' occur and will be 
able to remedy faults.

and teaching the students to attack fast and maintain their 
correct firing position although turning at wide angles. 
Practice No. 5 should involve an attack into the Range as used 
in the Pistol Instruction. 

The most common faults are loose holding, failing to obtain 
position with the left elbow under the gun, keeping the head 
up and not forcing the body into the target. These points must 
be continually emphasised, also the necessity of aggression 
and concentration in attack. 

The balance of 5 Rounds will be utilised as follows:

MACHINE CARBINE COURSE 

STEN GUN 


Period III . 

Stores - Sten Gun - 2 Magazines. 

A. 1. INTRODUCTION . 

This gun is known as the Sten Machine Carbine. Calibre - 9mm. 
Rate of Fire - 500 rounds per minute; it weighs approximately 
7 lbs. 

The magazine is of the box type holding 32 rounds. The 
magazine is difficult to fill by hand but there is a simple 
magazine filler which allows the rounds to be fed quickly and 
easily into the magazine. 

Demonstrate. 


It is natural that you will compare the Sten with the "Tommy 
Gun" and principally because of the rough appearance of the 
Sten, your comparison will not be favourable. 

This is wrong for the following reasons: 

a) It fires 9 mm. Luger (Parabellum) Ammunition. 

b) It is approximately 3 lbs. lighter than the Thompson. 

c) It has a very simple mechanism and the design allows for 
simple stripping. 

d) When stripped it is easily concealed. 

e) The Gun is fired dry. You do not have to keep the working 
parts oiled. 

f) Immersion in water, mud or sand does not interfere with the 
firing of the gun. 

The advantages of all these points are obvious. 

2. CHARACTERISTICS . 

The Sten is ideally suited for all types of close combat 
fighting. The lightness and design of the gun enable it to be 
used with extreme speed from the shoulder at all ranges. The 
maximum effective range is approximately 175 yards. 

3. MANIPULATION . 

To Prove : 

Hold the Gun at the "carry", i.e. gun under the arm, right 
hand round the pistol grip, muzzle pointing to the ground 
directly forward at an angle of about 45 degrees. Remove the 
magazine by grasping it with the fingers of the left hand and 










406 SOE SYLLABUS 


at the same time pressing the magazine catch which is on the 
top of the magazine housing. Then, turning the gun over to the 
left, work the bolt backwards and forwards two or three times 
and leave it in the forward position. 

To Load : 

Gun in "carry" position. With the left hand draw back the bolt 
and engage the cocking handle in the safety notch. Then turn 
the gun over to the right so that the left side is uppermost 
and verify the position of the change stud. This should be at 
single shot. See that it is, by pressing the stud inwards from 
left to right. Turn the gun upright. With the left hand insert 
the loaded magazine into the magazine housing, sending it 
smartly home and invariably pu ! L_awa y t gjna fce sure is 
locked in position . To prepare for firing, disengage the 
cocking handle from the safety notch and ease the bolt forward 
until it stops in the cocked or firing position. 

U n l oading 
As for Proving. 

Stoppages : 

Should a stoppage occur during firing, the first thing to do 
is to withdraw the bolt and engage the cocking handle in the 
safety notch. Then, remove the magazine and examine the breech 
to see the cause of stoppage. If there is an empty case or any 
other obstruction, shake it out, replace your magazine, ease 
the bolt into the cocked position and carry on firing. 

Note ; Before replacing magazine make sure that the top round 
is correctly positioned, otherwise another stoppage will 
immediately occur. 

Firing Position ; 

Owing to the light weight and the design of the Gun the normal 
man can engage targets efficiently, at close quarters, firing 
from the shoulder. With practice the gun can be brought into 
the shoulder firing position as fast as into the hip and as it 
is the more accurate position, it should be used for firing at 
all ranges, except at very close quarters, when a fast hip 
position is the most convenient. 

The shoulder position is adopted in the same way as the 
Thompson except that, as the Sten possesses no front grip, the 
left hand should grasp the cooling cylinder, taking care that 
thumb and forefinger are definitely in contact with the front 
edge of the cylinder or that the little finger bears hard up 
against the foresight. With any other grip the ejector cut is 
liable to be blocked by the hand, causing a stoppage and most 
probably damaged fingers. In prone shooting the left hand may 
be placed in front of the trigger guard but great care must be 
taken to keep the fingers below the line of travel of the 
recoiling cocking handle. On no account must this gun be 
grasped by the magazine during firing.

to take deliberate aim. 

Two magazines are carried, one charged with 8 rounds and one 
with 7 rounds. The eight round magazine is used on the Stalk, 
on completion of which the student immediately gets down 
behind cover and changes his magazine, inserting the second 
one holding seven rounds. He then engages the Spraying Target. 
















408 SOE SYLLABUS 


Note : Spraying Practice . 

The object of this is to practise the secondary purpose of the 
gun. Firing is to be done standing up, from the shoulder, at a 
plain white stream of painted canvas 7 yards long, 5 feet 
high, without aiming mark. The gun is traversed back and forth 
from one extremity of the screen to the other. Students should 
be warned of the tendency to shoot low at either extremity of 
the traverse and firing should be done as rapidly as possible. 

Period VI .

immediately to the Lecture Room or other convenient place, 
where he will carry out the following practice under another 
Instructor:

Note : Stripping will be demonstrated and practised during the

and used solely for this purpose and on no account will good 
condition springs be used. Our own method of assembling should 
be taught and practised, it is faster and does not rely on the 
use of any tools or implements and is therefore the most 
practical method to teach students. As a secondary method 
only, for those students who are unable to cope with our own 
method, the use of a nail to assist the spring into position 
should be shown.

APPENDIX "B" 


FOREIGN WEAPONS 


This subject is of great importance, and in view of the large number 
of weapons and the difficulty of housing them, a special 
establishment has been opened at which a course is run designed to 
suit the particular nationality of the students. All students 
receive instruction in German Weapons and in the Weapons of their 
particular country, and in addition are taught how to recognise the 
various types of ammunition used on the Continent. 

The object of the course is to teach students enough about the 
weapons which they are most likely to encounter in the field so that 
they can recognise them, select the correct ammunition, and put them 
into use immediately. 

It is not intended to make students into Armourers. 

During the course, students are given the opportunity of firing a 
number of the more common weapons.

March 1944 


CONSTRUCTION OF FIGHTING HOUSES 

The houses are built of rough timber as near to scale as possible 
and are not normally of more than one storey in height owing to the 
shortage of material and labour. The situation is important as it 
must be possible for students to fire in any direction or at least 
through 270 degrees. It is an advantage if there is high ground 
overlooking the site or high trees adjacent so that a suitable 
control tower can be constructed. 

Three houses are generally sufficient and they are placed as though 
forming a cul-de-sac. The impression of a street is achieved by 
building fences, gardens to houses, marking the roadway with 
sidewalks and erecting dummy lamp-posts, etc. 

Targets are made to be either automatic in action or controlled from 
the adjoining tower. By using automatic devices the aim is to 
achieve as much realism as possible and particularly to force the 
student to use the technique of gunfighting that he has been taught. 
Incidents can be created which will show him in a practical way the 
advantage of this technique. 

As an example of the foregoing, the following series of targets 
might be used: 

HOUSE "A" 

This house comprises one large room with two doors. 

Three targets represent Nazi officers sitting round a table. The 
table is situated in the corner farthest away from the main door. 

All the targets are hinged so that they can fall backwards out of 
sight. In front of the main door there is a partition extending into 
the centre of the room and a wire is stretched from the wall behind 
the partition around the end of it to a position on the wall on the 
right of the main doorway. A running target is attached to this 
wire. 

The operation of all the targets is by means of a series of weights 
actuated by a 'master' weight on a shelf behind the door. 

As the student attacks into the room through the main door he sees 
the three targets sitting round the table and he proceeds to 'kill' 
them. As he is in the process of doing this, the running target 
races round the corner of the partition straight towards him and 
simultaneously the three targets at the table disappear from view. 

The whole action from the time of entry has taken approximately 3- l 'i 
seconds and the student has had the task of 'killing' four targets 
during that period. 




SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 415 


The lessons brought out are: firstly, the necessity for sheer speed, 
and secondly, the necessity to utilise to the fullest those first 
few seconds when your opponent is motionless through shock of 
surprise. 

HOUSE "B" . 

This house also comprises one room, divided by a partition facing 
the door. There is a 'charging man' target which runs on a wire 
straight through the doorway into the street. This is weight- 
operated and controlled from the control tower. When the student is 
about to approach the door, the target is released and the door 
opened so that the target rushes out with considerable force 
straight at the student. 

Having dealt with this target the student enters the house. The 
partition faces him and on his right is a doorway which he has been 
told to investigate. This doorway leads to an underground tunnel 
which in turn leads to an underground chamber. There is a steep 
stairway leading down and in the tunnel there are various 'horror' 
devices: see-saw flooring, spring flooring, objects hanging from the 
roof, etc. As the student goes down the stairs the door behind him 
automatically closes, leaving him in almost complete darkness. The 
depth of the tunnel varies so that there is the impression of going 
deeper underground. As the student moves along the tunnel a glimmer 
of light discloses a man standing at the end. He fires at him and 
the target disappears through the roof, leaving the student in 
darkness again. At the end of the tunnel, steps lead to the chamber. 
As he proceeds up these a trap door about ten feet above his head 
opens and a man looks down. As the student fires the man disappears 
and the trapdoor slams back into the place. 

The chamber is dimly lit by a hurricane lamp, and as the student 
pulls aside a curtain at the entrance he sees a 'prisoner' bound to 
a chair, with a Nazi standing beside him. He 'kills' the Nazi and 
releases the prisoner. (The prisoner is an S.K. dummy). 

There are steep steps leading out of the chamber, and the student, 
carrying the dummy over his shoulder, makes his way up these and 
eventually arrives back on the ground floor of the house through a 
narrow doorway. As he is coming though this doorway he finds two 
Nazis waiting for him and it is necessary to 'kill' them immediately 
despite his burden and his cramped position. Having dealt with these 
opponents he deposits the 'prisoner' and prepares to attack the 
third house. 

This brings out the student's ability to handle the pistol or Sten 
efficiently although scared and in complete darkness and the ability 
to shoot effectively under all circumstances even when he is 
carrying a heavy object and in a cramped position. 

HOUSE 


This house also comprises one room with one door. Upon entering the 




416 SOE SYLLABUS 


door there is a full-length target standing beside an armchair 
against the opposite wall. The target is hinged to a post so that it 
can swivel. The chair is attached to a pulley overhead which is 
mounted on an inclined wire, which runs across the room to the wall 
on the right of the doorway. 

Against the right hand wall there is a double-tier bunk containing 
two figures as though asleep. When a central control is released the 
bottom figure throws back the bedclothes and the top figure sits up. 

There is also a trap-door in the floor. To the underside of the trap 
a head and shoulder figure is attached so that it appears when the 
trap is raised. 

On the left of the doorway there is the entrance to an enclosed 
staircase. From this two control wires run to the control tower. One 
when pulled causes a noise, as though somebody was running 
downstairs, the other causes a head-and-shoulder figure to look 
round the corner of the entrance to the staircase. 

All the targets, with the exception of the staircase figure, are 
controlled automatically from a release on the door. 

As the student attacks into the room he is confronted by the figure 
standing by the armchair. He kills this figure and then turns to 
deal with the men in bed; as he turns, the chair is thrown violently 
across the room in his direction and at the same time the trap-door 
is raised to disclose the figure underneath. After several seconds 
the noise of somebody running down the stairs is heard and the 
figure of a Nazi is momentarily shown at the foot of the stairs. 

Here the student is required to get right inside the room and fight 
fast, using his footwork to dodge missiles and at the same time to 
shoot efficiently whilst turning fast and engaging targets at 
different levels. 


Whilst crossing from house to house the student is called upon to 
deal with running targets representing men escaping and running 
across his front or running away from him. He also gets a momentary 
glimpse of targets looking out of windows. As he is leaving a house 
he might find a man waiting on the other side of the door. All the 
running targets are operated by weights controlled from the control 
tower. 


GENERAL • 


To add realism to the exercise and at the same time to practise the 
students in forming a proper plan of attack, a short narrative is 
generally given in which the houses are represented to form an enemy 
Battle H.Q. House "A" becomes Staff H.Q., House "B" partly disused - 
full occupation unknown but to be investigated. House "C" the 
Guardroom. 



SYLLABUS OF LECTURES 417 


The plan of attack is discussed and possible faults to be avoided 
brought out, e.g. forgetting to change magazines, attacking into a 
house with a half-empty magazine, standing in the doorway and not 
getting right inside, etc. 

From the control tower the behaviour of the student can be watched 
and his faults noted. After having fired, students are allowed to 
watch and criticise other students from the control tower.
