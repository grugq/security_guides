#CHARACTERISTICS OF AGENT COMMUNICATIONS
#AND OF AGENT HANDLING IN THE U.S.A.

###Lieutenant Colonel I. Ye. Prikhodko

####Training Manual
####1961

In this training circular we shall examine only those questions
of operating conditions in the U.S.A. and those facets of Ameri-
can counterintelligence tactics which affect our own agent com-
munication and handling.

The great distance which separates the U.S.A. from the So-
viet Union complicates the organization and support of direct
agent communication between the Center and our intelligence
units in the U.S.A. This forces our intelligence to employ dupli-
cate communications along many lines. There is a wide use of
the most modern radio equipment with a large operating ra-
dius, and, in case of need, we resort to radio relay stations.

Radio communication is of vital importance to _rezidentura_s op-
erating on the territory of the U.S.A. At the same time, the
extensive economic relations which the U.S.A. has with other
countries of the world facilitates the support of direct communi-
cations between the intelligence units located on the territory of
the U.S.A, and the Center and by postal and telegraph com-
munications.

The factor of time has always played an important role in
agent operations. Under modern conditions, when our potential
enemy is preparing for a war with widespread use of nuclear
missiles weapons and intends to launch a surprise attack On the
U.S.S.R. and other countries of the socialist camp, this factor
has become even more important.

Therefore it is necessary to work out in advance, during
peacetime, a reliable system of communications techniques
which an agent can use to inform the Center instantly about
enemy measures directed toward unleashing a sudden war.

To transmit these messages one must use the most modern
and most highly developed electronic technology, which should
be improved on continually.

If the imperialists unleash a war, the U.S.A. will be the target
of a crushing retaliatory strike causing damage to all the most
important political and economic centers of that country. Soviet
intelligence should thus adopt timely measures to guarantee the
security of its intelligence net. To achieve this it is necessary to
disperse operating _rezidentura_s and to move valuable single
agents some distance outside the limits of large cities. As for
agent nets engaged in collecting intelligence on atomic and mis-
sile bases, they should preferably consist of individual sources
equipped with radio having direct communication with the Cen-
ter.

We must mention that, to a significant extent, success In per-
forming intelligence tasks in the U.S.A. depends on agent han-
dling. Therefore we must devote serious attention to this sub-
ject.

##  CHARACTERISTICS OF AGENT COMMUNICATIONS

The characteristics of agent communications basically amount
to the use of specific methods in organization and utilization.
These depend on the characteristics of operating conditions
The way of life, customs, temper, demeanor, and personality
traits of Americans have specific significance. Most of Ameri-
cans are energetic, enterprising, and open people, having a
great sense of humor. They can be described as having business
acumen and as being resourceful, courageous, and industrious.

The over-all situation and the absolute power of money in the
U.S.A. arouses just one desire in many people——to make more
money. In describing a person Americans often use the expres-
sion, “He knows how to make money,” which means that such
a person has a lot of money. The other side of the question
specifically, where the money comes from or how it is “made,"
is not, as a rule, of interest to anybody. It can be said that
Americans encourage any method of getting rich.

American bourgeois propaganda tries in every way to con
vince the population that anyone can make money if he is
sufficiently resourceful.

Such a one—sided upbringing engenders in some of the peo-
ple an indifference to everything unconnected with business,
profits, and gain. An American’s circle of interests is often
rather small. Many Americans do not read books. Their main  
interest lies in advertisements, sports news, and cartoons; on the
front pages they only glance at the large sensational headlines.

Generally speaking, bourgeois society demoralizes people.

Every American family tries to save money for a “rainy day"; 
therefore a certain amount is set aside from each pay check. 

Wall Street does everything possible to keep Americans from
devoting their free time to meditation and deliberation. Movies,
cheap concerts, boxing, parks, horse races, baseball, football,
restaurants-—all these are used to divert the masses from 
realities around them.

In general, an American’s wants consist of having his own
automobile, a comfortable apartment, and a good time. Most
Americans, both men and women, smoke.

Americans are very concerned about clothes and outward ap-
pearances. They try always to have a clean suit, well pressed
with a good crease in the trousers, a clean shirt, and shoes well
polished. They send their suits regularly to the cleaner and their
shirts to the laundry, both of which are everywhere in the
U.S.A. It is customary to change white shirts and socks daily.

Clothing styles in the country change every year. Just as one
can determine accurately from specific features the year and
make of an automobile, so can one determine from outward ap-
pearances the class level of any American.

Despite the frequent change of styles, several general charac-
teristic features of American dress can still be noted: narrow
and short trousers, short sleeves, white shirt with a starched
collar (on important occasions), and always with a necktie. In
clothing, light colors predominate. Americans like loose-fitting
shoes, as a rule one or two sizes larger than necessary.

In his free time, when not at work, and especially during the
summer, the Americans wear sports clothes: light trousers,
short-sleeved shirts, no necktie. Sunglasses are in common use.
Outside the office an American’s behavior is free and relaxed.
Many Americans like to keep their hands in their pockets and
chew gum.

Agent communications and agent handling involves first and
last working with people, as a rule from the bourgeois world.
For this work to be successful, it is necessary to know these
people well, their characteristics and their personality traits, and
the political and economic circumstances which condition their
behavior.

An intelligence officer who does not know the characteristics
of the American way of life or who neglects those aspects can-
not be a full-fledged agent handler. Thus, for example, an intel-
ligence officer who has an outward slovenly appearance will not
command respect from an agent. If an agent does not have
sufficient dedication to our intelligence service, the result of this
and similar errors on the part of an intelligence officer may
leave the agent with the impression that he is working with an
inadequate and unreliable organization.

In the organization and utilization of agent communications
knowledge of the local area and local conditions is of the ut-
most importance. Not only the country as a whole, but even
every city, has its own individual features which influence agent
communications. They may complicate them or, on the con-
trary, facilitate their successful accomplishment.

New York, for example, is distinguished by its large size and
by the great number of its parks, museums, athletic grounds,
movie houses, libraries, and other public buildings. People of
the most different nationalities comprise a large segment of the
population. The city public transportation system, especially the
subways, is extensive, and there are a great many buses and
taxis.

In New York it is easy to establish a cover story for going
downtown either during the day or at night, because New York
has many public places. Skillful use of transportation facilities
makes it possible to make a good check for the detection of sur-
veillance. Finally, an intelligence officer who speaks with an ac-
cent  New York is quite acceptable since a large segment of
the city’s population speaks with an accent.

There are many large cities in the U.S.A. including such
giants as New York, Chicago, San Francisco, etc. The large
cities in the U.S.A. offer favorable conditions to organize agent
communications and to establish a cover story for them.

On the other hand the organization and utilization of agent
communications in Washington are full of difficulties because
of the city’s small size, its limited number of public places, no
subways, and an inadequate public transportation system, es-
pecially in the suburbs.

As we know, there are essentially two types of agent com-
munications: personal and impersonal.

Because they do not involve personal contact between case
officer and agent, impersonal communications afford the great-
est degree of secrecy to the activities of operational agents and
they greatly complicate the work of counterintelligence in the
identification and exploitation of our intelligence officers.

In the U.S.A., a country with a highly developed counterin-
telligence effort, the basic type of agent communications is
impersonal communications, the importance of which is con-
stantly growing. The task of operational agents consists of us-
ing impersonal communications creatively and perfecting their
manner of organization.

However, one must remember that proper agent handling and
the development of the greatest effectiveness in working with
agents require periodic personal meetings with them.

## 1. Personal Communications

Only by personal contact between intelligence officer and
agent is it possible to study the agent better, to discover his real
feelings, to check on and control his work, and finally——and
this is of utmost importance——to instruct the agent, to train him
in new methods and in professional intelligence skills, to de-
velop him, and to exert an inffuence on him through personal
example.

The basic types of direct communications are the meeting,
the recognition meeting[3] and communications through a cut-
out or transmission points.

[3] “recognition meeting” is an intelligence contact at which a Soviet in-
telligence officer and an agent meets first for the purpose of mutual recogni-
tion, on the basis of prearranged place, time, and identifying marks.]

### Meetings

A meeting between intelligence officer and agent is one of the
most vulnerable means of communications. Therefore, in or-
ganizing a meeting, an intelligence officer must anticipate every-
thing in order to guarantee security.

In organizing a meeting, the closest attention must be paid to
such questions as the meeting time, the meeting place, the meet-
ing agenda, the meeting cover story, and the measures to ensure
security.

Meetings should be varied as to time of day, days of the
week, and dates of the month. For example, meetings should
not be held on the fifth day of each month, on Wednesday of
every week, or consistently at 8 P.M., because such consistency
in the activities of an intelligence officer makes the work of
counterintelligence easier. In fact, in order to compromise an
operation it would be sufficient for counterintelligence to in-
tensify its surveillance on our intelligence officer for only one
day of the month (for example, the fifth of the month) , for one
day of the week (for example, on Wednesday), and even for
only a certain time——until 8 P.M.

Neither, however, should there be an unlimited juggling of
times. In choosing a time for a meeting, one must take into con-
sideration the agent’s working conditions, his hours of work, his
family situation, and the meeting place and area. Consideration
should be given to the fact that the agent must have a plausible
explanation for his absence from work or his departure from
home.

Most Americans spend their days off and holidays with their
families or with relatives and friends. Besides this, an agent has
family holidays—-birthdays of members of the family. An in-
telligence officer must consider these circumstances, hear the
agent’s views, and not schedule a meeting on days which are
holidays for the agent and for members of his family.

Most meetings are held in the evening. As a rule, the agent
does not work in the evening and does not have to ask permis-
sion of his boss to leave. In addition, evenings provide the great-
est security. It is not recommended, however, to hold meetings
in a park, because, unlike Europeans, Americans visit parks
only during the day. At the approach of darkness nobody uses
the parks. At that time of the day only criminal elements and
persons who are mentally ill can be found in the parks. In the
press one can find special warnings concerning the danger in
going to parks in the evening. It is not unusual for the news-
papers to publish detailed accounts of rapes and murders which
were committed in the parks during the night.

One may also hold meetings in the middle of the day and
during lunch (Americans have their lunch from 1 to 2 P.M.). If
it is within his pattern of activities, the agent may leave his
office during the day. If such is the case, one can meet him at
any time of the day.

Finally, meetings can be held in the morning, before work,
because the majority of office workers start work at 9 A.M. and
some even at 10 A.M.

We know that at certain periods, which may last from one
to several months, counterintelligence concentrates its main ef-
forts on working days during the working hours of Soviet in-
stallations, while during preholiday days and holidays, as well
as during the morning hours, only preventive measures are in a
force. Our intelligence officers must always take into consid-
eration all aspects of the counterintelligence agents’ modus
operandi and conduct their clandestine activities during those
days and hours when counterintelligence is least active. The
selection of times and dates must always be selected with the
agent.

As a rule, meetings should be as short as possible; therefore
very careful preparations are necessary. In organizing communi-
cations from a third country, or from the Center to the U.S.A.,
and especially in organizing radio communications, one should
consider the American practice of changing the time during the
summer to be one hour ahead of standard time. Clocks are
moved ahead one hour (so—called summer or daylight time,
“daylight-saving time”) starting at 2 A.M. on the last Sunday
in April and ending at 2 A.M. on the last Sunday in September,
when clocks are moved back one hour throughout the U.S.A.,
with the exception of Indiana and Nebraska where daylight time
is in effect all year.

In choosing a meeting site, it is necessary of course to con-
sider the characteristics of the country as a whole and, above
all, the characteristics of the area. As a whole, conditions in the
cities of New York and Washington, for example, are favorable
for the organization of agent communications. However, not all
areas of such cities are suitable for this. For example, of New
York’s five sections, which are called “boroughs,” Richmond is
less suitable than the other areas for organizing agent commu-
nications. The reason for this is its isolation from the main city.
One can reach the island only by ferry (ferry crossings for
Richmond are made from Manhattan and from Brooklyn) or
by the bridge connecting Richmond with Bayonne and Jersey
City.

New York’s other four sections--Manhattan, Bronx, Brook-
lyn, and Queens--are widely used by our intelligence officers for
the organization of agent communications.

However, differences exist not only among the five sections
of New York, but also among different sections of the city
within the very same area. For example, let us take Manhattan,
which is the business area of the city. Negro Harlem is unsuit-
able for the organization of agent communications in Manhattan.
It is located north of Central Park, and the Chinese quarter,
located downtown, is also difficult for agents. Extreme squalor
distinguishes the Chinese quarter. A properly dressed person
will stand out sharply there. As for Negro Harlem, white people
cross it only by automobile. A white person is unsafe there, be-
cause the Negroes regard every white person who comes there
as a curiosity-seeker who came to view them much as people go
to the zoo to view the animals in cages.

We do not recommend that meetings be held in the area
between Forty-second and Thirty—fourth Streets. This is the
busiest part of midtown and therefore has the widest coverage
by the police and by counterintelligence.

Likewise, it is inadvisable to hold meetings in the vicinity of
the UN Building (along the shore of the East River, between
Forty-second and Forty-eighth Streets), near buildings of the
permanent representations of various countries to the UN and,
above all, the delegations to the UN of representations of so-
cialist countries (the representation of the U.S.S.R. to the
United Nations is located at 680 Park Avenue), nor in the vi-
cinity of large banks, jewelry stores, etc.

In Washington, meetings should not be held in the central
part of the city, where Congressional buildings, the White
House, departmental buildings and other governmental offices,
large banks, stores, and restaurants are located. Neither should
they be held on the main streets of the city, or in areas where
foreign embassies and, especially, the embassies of the U.S.S.R.
and other countries of the socialist camp are located. Meetings
should also not be held in areas near military objectives or in
the Negro district.

Generally, an operation can be compromised through the im-
proper selection of a meeting site. For example, an intelligence
officer, who did not know the city well, once selected a meeting
place with an agent on a street corner in the evening. A large
bank stood on this corner. The intelligence officer arrived for
the meeting exactly at the appointed time. The agent was late.
The intelligence officer was there for less than two minutes when
a policeman approached, asked him what he was doing there,
and requested him to move along. The intelligence officer had
to leave quickly. In addition, two plainclothesmen followed him
until he entered a subway station. The meeting was not held.

In another instance, the site selected for a recognition meet-
ing was a bus stop served by only one bus. Our intelligence of-
ficer who was supposed to meet an agent at an appointed time
arrived at the meeting site. To guarantee the security of the
meeting, another intelligence officer countersurveilled the meet-
ing from a bench in a square near the meeting site. Because
the agent did not appear for the meeting that day, both intelli-
gence officers went home. This was repeated two more times.
On the third day the agent himself approached our intelligence
officer, not the one waiting for him at the bus stop, but the one
sitting on the bench in the square and made contact with him.
It was later learned that the agent passed the meeting place
each time, sat on a bench in the square, and watched the in-
telligence officers. He had decided not to come to the bus stop,
as he considered it unnatural to wait there because he had no
plausible cover story. Only on the third day was the agent con-
vinced that the man sitting in the square was a Soviet intelli-
gence officer. He then approached him, because he considered
the square a more appropriate meeting site.

The best boroughs for holding meetings are the Bronx,
Brooklyn, and Queens, as well as various parts of Manhattan
(the area near Columbia University, the area adjoining River-
side Park, the area east of Lexington Avenue, and others).

As we know, we must select a meeting site that is secure and
convenient for holding the meeting. It must also be such that
an appearance there can be explained plausibly and convinc-
ingly by a cover story. Among such places are crowded streets,
parks, sports fields, sports clubs, restaurants, motels, beaches,
etc.

Most streets in American cities, including Washington and
New York, are quite regular and well planned, and intersect at
right angles.

In New York many streets have ordinal numbers as names.
In Manhattan, for example, only the far downtown district has
word names for streets. North Houston Street begins the num-
bered streets: First, Second, etc., through 207th. Fifth Avenue
divides Manhattan into two parts: west (in the direction of the
Hudson River) and east (in the direction of the East River).
Addresses therefore are indicated as follows: 302 W. Fifty-
sixth St., N.Y. This means: house (more often, the entrance)
no. 302, the western part of Fifty-sixth St., N.Y. One should
also give an address this way when speaking. Manhattan ave-
nues run north—south, and many of them are numbered. Streets
cross from east to west. In general, the city is well planned,
and a person can learn his way around with relative ease.

Queens and the Bronx have a good many quiet streets which
are good places to meet.

In Washington, all the north—south streets have number
names, and those which go from east to west have a letter (for
example: A Street or D Street) or a name. Avenues run diago-
nally and are named after states. Because a street with the same
number or name can be in each of the four sections of the city,
in writing an address it is necessary to indicate the section of
the city. For example, 415 Fifteenth St., N.W., Washington,
D.C. . .

Because of the way New York and Washington are laid out,
they offer the possibility of holding meetings while walking out-
doors. For such a meeting an agent is told not the spot (point)
of an area but the location of the route, as a rule a small (short)
street along which he is to walk at a given time. In such a case,
the intelligence officer can observe the agent to determine
whether or not he is under surveillance and can then establish
contact at the most convenient place.

In selecting a meeting site, one must consider possible sudden
changes in the weather which are quite typical of the climate in
the coastal areas of the U.S.A. Sunny weather frequently be-
comes rainy, and vice versa. Americans listen to the weather
forecast and, if bad weather is predicted, they take an umbrella
and raincoat; Americans do not wear rubbers. Both men and
women use umbrellas. Thus, before going to a meeting, an in-
telligence officer should listen to the weather forecast and, if
necessary, take an umbrella or a raincoat. In. addition, he
should plan for the possibility of rain by selecting a covered
place in the vicinity where a meeting can be held (store en-
trances, subway stations, movie theaters, museums, libraries, res-
taurants, drugstores, and others)... 

The existence of a subway in New York helps locating dif-
ferent places in the city. It should be borne in mind, however
that the subway system there is quite complicated and should
be studied carefully before planning to use it for operational
purposes.

In learning the subways and the city, one should make ex-
tensive use of directories, guidebooks, and maps.

Parks can serve as meeting places. New York parks are usu-
ally grassy fields with only occasional patches of trees and
bushes. There are many play areas in the parks. The footpaths
are of asphalt. Main roads often cut through the parks.

Washington parks are even more unusual. They are usually
full of wooded areas and are dissected by main roads near
which there are a number of parking places and picnic areas.
In general, there are no footpaths. It is not customary to take
strolls through the parks.

All of the parks are free. The people make considerable use
of them for resting, sports, and exercise. Walking on the grass
is permitted in many parks.

Most athletic clubs are open to the public, including foreign-
ers. Golf is the most popular sport among the well-to—do. Agent
meetings can be held at golf courses as easily as in other athletic
clubs. During the week there are very few people at the golf
courses. On these days the intelligence officer and his agent can
arrive at the golf course (preferably at different times, twenty
to thirty minutes apart), each can begin to play alone, and at a
previously designated time can meet at, let us say, the sixteenth
hole or at some other hole (there is a total of eighteen holes).
Saturdays and Sundays are less suitable days for holding agent
meetings at golf courses because on these days many players
gather, tournaments are held, and single play is not permitted.
Golf courses are found on the edges of wooded areas or parks
in broken terrain where there are many hidden areas. These
hidden areas are the best places for holding meetings. In some
cases, meetings can be held in clubhouse restaurants.

To hold successful meetings at golf courses, one should learn
the conditions there ahead of time. A basic requirement is to
know the game and how to play it. Therefore students should
learn this game while still at the academy.

Club membership is rather expensive. Also, not all clubs are
equally accessible to our intelligence officers. It is even difficult
for local residents, to say nothing of foreigners, to get into some
golf clubs, if they do not have a certain position in society.

As a rule, a candidate for membership must be recommended
by two or three club members.

New York has golf courses in Pelham Bay Park, Van Cort-
landt Park (the Bronx); in Dyker Beach Park (Brooklyn); in
Forest Park and Alley Park (Queens); in Latourette Park and
Silver Lake Park (Richmond); and others. With club member-
ships so difficult to obtain it is advisable to use public golf
courses.

New York and Washington have numerous restaurants,
many of them representing different nationalities. Each restau-
rant has its own distinctive characteristics. One may specialize
in steaks (the most expensive steaks are sirloin and T-bone
steak), another in seafood; some restaurants have orchestras,
others have not. Before selecting a certain restaurant as a meet-
ing site, one should learn everything about that restaurant; the
system of service, the type of customers, whether it has a bad
reputation with the police, etc.

It is the practice in all restaurants to tip the waitress 10 per
cent of the amount shown on the check.

Depending on the nature of the agent operation, the officer
and agent may sit at the same table and hold the meeting during
dinner. Or they may sit at separate tables, keeping only visual
contact for the purpose of exchanging prearranged signals, and
have the meeting later on the street after leaving the restaurant.
Restaurants are frequently used as a refuge from bad, rainy
weather.

Americans like to spend their time in bars. Many bars have no
tables. Customers sit on high round stools next to the bar. As a
rule, bars do not provide snacks or hot dishes. One can order
only drinks: whisky, gin, beer, etc. In order not to attract undue
attention the intelligence officer must know how to order suf-
ficiently well. It is not enough, for example, to ask, “Give me a
glass of beer.” It is also necessary to name the brand of beer
(“Schlitz,” “Rheingold,” etc.). For the customers’ amusement,
most proprietors install a television set in a corner above the bar.
Customers often sit over a single glass of beer for several hours
watching television programs.

It is highly recommended to hold meetings in small restau-
rants located in the residential area of a city.

The American pharmacy (drugstore) is quite different from
European pharmacies. Its assortment of goods is not limited to
medicines. In many drugstores one can buy the latest news-
papers or magazines, purchase food products, have a cup of cof-
fee, or make a telephone call. American drugstores, especially
in the large cities, have almost become department stores.
Therefore they are never without customers. Drugstores can be
used to hold short meetings, as well as for other agent activities
(signaling, clandestine phone calls).

Along the highways between cities and near cities there are
many motels. A motel is a small hotel by the highway where
people traveling by car can spend the night. Generally there are
vacancies. The manager always writes down the license number
of the car and the driver’s name in a special register. No regis-
tration is required of other passengers.

Each motel room has its own entrance. One may leave the
motel at any time. Also, the manager need not be informed in
advance of one’s departure. As a rule, people depart from a
motel early in the morning. The bill is paid when the room is
rented.

It is easy to hold meetings in a hotel of this type.

It is advisable to use motels in cases in which it is necessary
to hold a long meeting with an agent in a closed and isolated
location, e.g., when it is necessary to train an agent in radio or
in the use of operational techniques. The ability to park the car
near one’s room or in a nearby garage facilitates the secret un-
loading of equipment.

Even American movie theaters are distinctive. Most movie
theaters in large cities are open from 12 noon to 1 A.M. Movie-
goers enter as soon as they get their tickets and they may take
any unoccupied seat. The moviegoer leaves whenever he wishes,
but, as a rule, he leaves when another showing begins. Films
are shown continuously. Americans are not content with only a
single feature film. Therefore, movie-theater proprietors show
two films, one after the other, which lasts three to four hours.

Intelligence officers can make extensive use of movie theaters
when organizing agent communications by spending a certain
amount of time in them before a meeting. The fact is that there
are few people in most movie theaters, especially on weekdays
during working hours. Movie theaters located away from the
center of the city are often practically empty. Thus, by arriving
at a designated time at a previously determined movie theater
and taking advantage of the many empty seats, the intelligence
officer and agent can hold a meeting right in the theater. As an
alternative, they can use the foyer where there are frequently
many vending machines selling cigarettes, cold drinks, chewing
gum, etc.

Agent meetings can also be held in outdoor movie theaters
(drive-in theaters) where one can see the films from one’s car.

In the U.S.A. where the counterintelligence effort is highly
developed, planning and preparation for a meeting are of the
greatest importance. In planning a meeting one should give the
greatest consideration to the above-mentioned characteristics of
the people and of the country, the working and family situation
of the agent, his capabilities, etc. Insofar as the intelligence of-
ficer himself is concerned, he should thoroughly work out his
own conduct. All his movements, his daily routine, his appear-
ances in the city, and his visits to movie theaters, libraries, and
sporting events must be subordinated to one purpose -- achiev-
ing a more flexible and covert system of agent communications.
In this regard, all his activities must be natural and plausible.

In planning a meeting, one must consider the site, the nature
of the site, and the time of the previous meeting, so that the
next meeting be held at a different site and, if possible, at a dif-
ferent time. In New York, for example, it is possible to alternate
the use of the different “boroughs”——the Bronx, Queens,
Brooklyn, Richmond, and Manhattan.

At the same time a meeting site is selected, places must be
provided along the route to the meeting site where signals can
be posted. Signals can be arranged along this route to cancel a
meeting. This is done with the help of radio technological means
in those cases in which it is established that the officer who is
on his way to an agent is under surveillance. Before going to
the meeting site, the officer must ascertain that there are no sig-
nals which cancel the meeting.

The question of leaving for a meeting must be thoroughly
planned. It is particularly important that those officers working
in a _rezidentura_ under cover know how to leave their offices quite
naturally at both a reasonable and required time, how to explain
their visits to certain public places, and how to make their
“spot checks” along the route. The continuity and regularity
of agent communications depend on such planning.

Under present working conditions, one should start for a
meeting not later than two to three hours before the scheduled
time. During this time one must check along the stipulated
route to detect any surveillance by the counterintelligence serv-
ice. If surveillance is detected, one must carry out his cover
reason for leaving, then return to the point of departure to at-
tempt to make another secure departure. At times the intelli-
gence officer will have to make several tries before he succeeds
in evading surveillance. In most cases, therefore, the intelligence
officer leaves his office quite early. For example, if on the day
of a meeting, while on his way to or from lunch, an intelligence
officer notices that he is not being watched, there is no need for
him to go home for lunch or to return to work after lunch. He
goes to the city, makes another very careful check, spends the
rest of his time in a movie theater or some other area which
affords security, and appears at the meeting site at the desig-
nated time.

Below are several examples which illustrate an intelligence of-
ficer’s method of departure for a meeting and the nature of an
intelligence officer’s actions.

An intelligence officer had a Sunday meeting scheduled for
the latter part of the day. After breakfast he took his family
for a walk in the park. He usually took such a walk every Sun-
day. On the way he invited a friend. The two families chose
some benches in the park and seated themselves in the sun. The
adults talked and glanced through newspapers and magazines
which they had bought at a stand, while the children played
nearby. They all visited the zoo together, and they also looked
at some monuments. While passing a movie theater, they looked
at the advertising display and decided to see the new film. They
all went inside. The intelligence officer who had a meeting
scheduled quickly departed through a side door and left for the
meeting site along a previously selected route. The meeting was
successful. Toward evening the intelligence officer and his
family returned home after a restful Sunday.

In another case, a meeting was designated for a Monday
evening. After work on Saturday, the intelligence officer left for
the house in the country where some families spent all summer
and where most of the Soviet officials spent Saturdays and Sun-
days. As usual on Monday morning he returned to the city in
his car. On the way, observing that he was not under surveil-
lance he decided to take advantage of this opportunity. He did
not go to work but parked his car instead on a street (some
distance from his place of business-—and from the meeting site).
He then took a subway and went to a different part of the city.
He got off the subway at an uncrowded station and confirmed the
absence of surveillance; he then bought a newspaper and again
boarded the subway. Later the intelligence officer got off at an-
other station and went to an Automat for breakfast. Still there
was no surveillance. After breakfast the intelligence officer
made several more trips on the subway and fully confirmed the
absense of any surveillance. To avoid being detected on the
streets by the counterintelligence service, the intelligence officer
entered a movie theater. Twenty to thirty minutes before the
scheduled meeting, he left the movie theater and proceeded to
the meeting site, again checking en route. The meeting took
place at the designated time.

The intelligence officer must think through in advance all
such problems connected with the planning and conduct of a
meeting, including possible variations of departures, and make
a report for the _rezident_.

Conduct of a meeting is the basic phase of agent operations.
Meetings play an important role in the training of an agent.
Therefore they should be conducted in a precise, well-planned
manner, with a thorough knowledge of the case and paying at-
tention to all circumstances. During the meeting the intelligence
officer must not only describe the order of the meeting with the
agent and the cover story for the meeting, review the instruc-
tions for the alternate meeting, hear the agent’s report, and as-
sign him tasks, but he must also instruct him in various mat-
ters, listen to his questions, and give him competent answers.
The officer must take a constant interest in the agent’s personal
affairs and situation so that the agent can be cautioned in ad-
vance, if need be, about possible errors in his conduct.

Because meetings should not be too lengthy, the intelligence
officer must be well prepared for each meeting. During the meet-
ing he must be alert to catch the most fleeting changes in the
agent’s mood. To a large extent, an officer’s authority depends
on his conduct, his discussion of operational matters, the ability
to conceal the fatigue which he might be feeling after a long
trip and many security checks. Nor should he show any nerv-
ousness, whatever the external reasons might be. If the officer
exhibits stability and self-control, the agent will acquire confi-
dence in working with our intelligence service.

Despite the fact that very important problems are being dis-
cussed at a meeting, the case officer should have a sense of
humor, something which is valued highly by American agents.
be able to tell appropriate jokes, and enliven the conversation.
This aids in establishing good rapport with the agent.

##Recommendations for the Conduct of Intelligence Officers
##Engaged in Personal Communications

The conduct of an intelligence officer bears directly on his
work with agents. The people with whom the intelligence of-
ficer comes in contact must be convinced that all his actions
and his bearing are determined by his job, by the nature of his
personal life, and by his cultural tastes. He must accustom those
around him to a pattern of activities which naturally includes
agent work. To overcome the obstacles of counterintelligence,
our intelligence officers, besides following the general rules of
intelligence operations, must adopt special measures. The intel-
ligence officers in a _rezidentura_ under cover, who are under con-
stant surveillance by the counterintelligence service, are particu-
larly compelled to make considerable use of these measures.

We know that stationary counterintelligence observation posts
carefully record the time that all employees of Soviet installa-
tions arrive for work and the time they depart. The counterin-
telligence service can draw up charts on the arrival and depar-
ture of our colleagues using them to organize their surveillance.
To invalidate such “charts” and make it impossible for the
counterintelligence service to establish any kind of regular or re-
current pattern of the length of time our colleagues stay inside
an installation, we must explain trips to the city on operational
matters by hiding and disguising them. Such trips are made
under the pretense of conducting personal business--visits to
movie theaters, museums, exhibitions, and athletic events, the
purchase of personal articles, etc.

During a trip to the city, the intelligence officer checks for
surveillance. If he is sure that he is not under surveillance, the
intelligence officer uses this trip to the city to get a better
knowledge of the city, to choose new meeting places, dead
drops, and locations for posting signals, and to select and con-
firm routes along which checks can be made for surveillance.
If he detects surveillance, the intelligence officer must act ac-
cording to a previously conceived cover plan: he can act like a
person who is very interested in books and, consequently, visit
a number of bookstores, or he can pretend to be a devotee of
baseball, the most popular sport in the U.S.A. It would be help-
ful if an intelligence officer could give the impression that he is
fond of taking walks about the city. At the same time, he must
try to learn the methods of surveillance. Under no circum-
stances must he reveal that he has detected the surveillance, in
order not to show his familiarity with the modus operandi of the
counterintelligence service. Similarly, an intelligence officer who
is under surveillance must not exhibit nervousness or do any-
thing which is unnatural.

The officer should analyze each trip to the city, make con-
clusions on the operating methods of the counterintelligence
service and on the city and public places. These conclusions
should be written down in a special notebook. Gradually the in-
telligence officer will accumulate a collection of very valuable
material. The intelligence officer having such notes can adjust
more easily to operating conditions. He can select meeting
places ahead of time in widely scattered areas, as well as dead
drops and places for posting signals. He will be able to develop
more plausible cover stories for his actions connected with agent
operations.

American stores periodically hold sales of their merchandise
at lowered prices. At the beginning of the sale a large number
of people usually gather at the store. In their efforts to adver-
tise the sale, the proprietors invite newspaper photographers to
the opening of the sale. To avoid being caught by the photog-
rapher’s lens, our intelligence officers and members of their
families should not visit the store during the beginning Of the
sale.

It is recommended that intelligence officers take more fre-
quent walks about the city at different times. Depending on his
work load and the purpose for the walks, he can take walks
after work, before work, and during his lunch hour. After he
“accustoms” the counterintelligence service to such walks, the
intelligence officer can use them later to support agent com-
munications (posting or checking of signals), agent meetings,
servicing dead drops, etc.

Every intelligence officer who handles agents must have pre-
viously selected and well-learned countersurveillance check
routes which afford the most favorable opportunities for the de-
tection of surveillance.

A countersurveillance check route may include travel by au-
tomobile (which can then be parked on a side street or in some
city garage); the use of uncrowded streets, especially in those
areas where parallel surveillance is impossible; travel by subway
with several transfers at quiet stations; visits to large stores and
other buildings with numerous elevators, entrances, and exits,
and which also have direct access to subways (Pennsylvama
Station, Macy’s and Saks department stores, Chrysler Building,
and others).  

At the same time that such routes are being selected, a good
cover story should also be developed to explain the intelligence
officer’s presence in a certain area.

Detecting surveillance, the intelligence officer must not go to
meet the agent; but he must spend some time naturally in the
city, thereby convincing the counterintelligence agents of his
reason for being in the city, and then return home. Thus, the
surveillance agents will have to report that their quarry was not
seen committing any clandestine act.

Generally, as we mentioned, there is no particular need for
the intelligence officer to return to the _rezidentura_ late after an
evening meeting. Nevertheless, he must, inform the _rezident_
about the meeting by passing or posting a prearranged signal:
“Meeting held; all is well," or, “Meeting did not take place,”
etc. The type of signal will depend on particular conditions: the
working and personal relationships between the officer and
_rezident_, etc. The signal can be noted by the _rezident_ himself,
by his chauffeur, or by any other intelligence officer who  free
that day. A detailed report on the operation can be made the
next day.

The U.S. counterintelligence service regards all Soviet em-
ployees as possible intelligence officers and constantly attempts
to determine which of them has special work to do. With this
in mind, a number of means are employed, the main ones are
eavesdropping (in apartments, in automobiles, on the street,
etc.) , surveillance, and the study and analysis of the conduct of
Soviet employees. With this fact in mind, the intelligence officer
must not discuss operational matters outside the confines of the
specially equipped room in the _rezidentura_ and he must conduct
himself so as not to arouse the suspicion of those around him.
It is vital that he avoid establishing a pattern in his intelligence
work.

In organizing agent communications the intelligence officer
will often have to make use of the public transportation system.
The subway is the primary means of transportation in New
York.

There are no ticket collectors on the subway. There are special
metal revolving gates at the entrance. The ticket office does not
sell tickets but only metal tokens which cost fifteen cents. In
passing through the revolving gate, the passenger inserts the
token in a special slot.

An intelligence officer should always have several tokens with
him, especially on the day of a meeting, so as not to waste any
time in buying them at the subway entrance.  

It is hard to imagine how an operation for maintaining agent
communications can be conducted in New York without using
the subway, which, despite its complexity, facilitates one’s orien-
tation in the city. It also affords a convenient place to check
on the existence or absence of surveillance.

Inadequate knowledge of the city’s means of transporta-
tion, especially the subway, can sometimes lead to the cancella-
tion of an agent meeting. The following example will under-
score this point:

Our officer left for a meeting at the designated time. After
carrying out a carefully planned check, he was convinced that
he was not under surveillance. Twenty minutes remained before
the meeting. During that time he had to go to the meeting
site and once more confirm the lack of surveillance. According
to his plan, he was required to use the subway for this purpose.
At a quiet station he boarded a subway going in the opposite
direction from the meeting site, and planned to get off at the
next station and take a train back to the meeting site.

There were hardly any passengers in the subway car. A man
sat down near him, opened a paper, and began to read.

The officer passed one stop and then got off. The man with
the newspaper, apparently recollecting something suddenly,
folded his newspaper quickly and also got off the subway. The
intelligence officer was alerted. He got on the next train and
sat down. The man with the newspaper sat down in the same
car and again began to read his paper. The intelligence officer
became alarmed—-this was obvious surveillance. He rode past
his stop. The man with the newspaper did not appear to be
paying any attention to him. Finally, the intelligence officer
could stand it no longer and got off the subway. The stranger
did not even lift his head and rode on. None of the other pas-
sengers got off. The intelligence officer went out on the street
and made a check—-no external surveillance. But by then it
was too late to make the meeting. He made another check, con-
firmed the lack of surveillance, then went home. An important
meeting was canceled.

It was later determined that the intelligence officer had at
first taken a local train, had passed his stop and then had
taken an express going in the opposite direction. Local residents
frequently do the same thing, when they have a long way to
go. They get on at the nearest intermediate station and take a
train going in the direction of the closest express stop and then
transfer to an express. Our officer did not consider this because
he did not know subway system.

Buses stop at the request of passengers. Before his stop, the
passenger must pull a cord overhead which serves as a signal
to the driver. The driver also stops the bus when signaled by
passengers waiting at a stop, providing, however, that there is
room on the bus.

Buses operate without conductors.

One enters a bus through the front door and exits through
the rear. By the driver is a small meter similar to a small box
into which the passenger drops fifteen cents in New York and
twenty cents in Washington. The driver allows the entrance
and departure of passengers, makes change, and hands out
transfers (at the request of the passenger). He gives change
for bills but only up to five dollars. Thus the intelligence officer
must always be certain that he has small change or one-dollar
bills.

Tickets are not used on buses. The system for streetcars is
the same as for buses.  

Taxis do not have stands. In additions, they are not allowed
to stop on the street for any length of time, because the streets
are full of traffic. Taxis move constantly, stopping only for pas-
sengers. A taxi can be stopped anywhere; this is done merely 
by waving the hand or by loudly shouting, "Taxi!" when an
empty one passes.

The driver writes in his log the place a fare entered his taxi,
the place he got out, and the time. Therefore an intelligence
officer must never take a taxi direct to the meeting place. To
use taxis properly in operational work, the officer must know
several addresses in different areas and to be prepared to give
the driver a destination at a moment’s notice.

In the U.S.A. our intelligence officers make extensive use of
personal cars (especially in Washington), not as a site for meet-
ing or talking with an agent, but as a way of going to the meet-
ing area, and of detecting and losing surveillance. The reason is
that the counterintelligence service can secretly install in Soviet
employees’ cars special eavesdropping microphones or devices
which emit a signal giving the location of the car.

Automobiles are very widely used as a means of transporta-
tion in the U.S.A. An automobile is a necessity in the way of life
of the American family. All the streets in the large cities are
filled with automobiles. It is difficult to find a free place to
park. There are not enough garages and parking lots to meet
the demand. Nevertheless, there is always room on parking lots
and in garages (old large buildings are often made over into
garages). This is because their fees are so high. For example,
the cost of parking a car in the center of Manhattan can be as
much as seventy-five cents, and even one dollar, for the first
hour, up to a maximum of three dollars per day.

The intelligence officer using an automobile in arranging com-
munications should always park his car in a garage or a par-
ticular place a considerable distance from the meeting site, even
in a different borough. He should continue his mission using
public transportation.

There are many companies in the U.S.A. which rent cars. All
that is required to rent a car is to present one’s driver’s license
and leave a small deposit. Use of rented cars in the organiza-
tion of agent communications is recommended, because this has
a number of advantages. For instance, an intelligence officer can
drive to the city in his own car, check for surveillance, and
then leave it in a suitable area or in a parking lot. He can
then complete his job in a rented car. This use of automobiles
makes the work of the counterintelligence service more difficult.

The largest car rental company is the “Hertz Rent a Car
Service.”

There are many toll bridges in the U.S.A. The
toll is collected by a policeman (about twenty to twenty five
cents for a one-way trip). We assume that at these points notice 
is taken of cars with diplomatic plates, especially of those cars
whose drivers are employees of Soviet installations. Therefore
we must avoid such places when carrying out intelligence tasks
and use instead bridges without toll where it is more difficult
to keep track of cars.

[EDITOR’s NOTE: At this point one page is missing from the
original document. The missing material evidently includes
further discussion of clandestine meetings between intelligence
operatives, as well as types of recognition signs and key words
(“paroles”) for mutual identification of Soviet officers and
their agents.]

which can be with initials, some kind of figure in the form
of a stamp or a mark, or some kind of special stone. Besides
rings, Women wear many ornaments around the neck, on the
hands, and on their clothing. Depending on the sex of the
agent, any of these can be used as a recognition sign.

Americans make widespread use of various wrapping papers
with advertisements in the form of writing, photographs, colored
pictures, etc.  Small objects (a box for vitamins or chewing
gum) with a distinctive packaging can also be used as recogni-
tion signs.

The best parole is the question, and the countersign, the
answer to the question. Both parole and the countersign have
predetermined words or phrases. These predetermined words
can be the names of museums, movie theaters, libraries, and
monuments or the titles of movies, books, newspapers, maga-
zines, etc. Both the question and the answer must be short and
simple in content and in pronunciation. We know that it is
difficult to pronounce some English words. In this regard,
additional difficulties may confront our officers who have just
arrived in the country.

In arranging for a recognition meeting and, above all, for the
recognition signs, parole, and countersign, the intelligence officer
has sufficient opportunity to exhibit his initiative, resourceful-
ness, and creativity, and to solve all problems with originality
and with due consideration to local conditions.

### Communication Through Cut-outs[4] and Live Drops

In individual cases it becomes necessary to resort to cut-outs
and live drops as a means of arranging communications.

In each agent operation, the case officer very carefully trains
a cut—out: he instructs and trains him, instills in him the desired
qualities, and monitors his fulfillment of tasks. Even when com-
munications are through a cut-out, it is still necessary for
the case officer to meet periodically with the agent to determine
personally whether the work is going properly and whether
the tasks are conveyed to the agent. The officer must take an
interest in the relations between the cut-out and the agent in
order to influence the entire course of the work.

If the agent lives in another city, the cut-out must have the
opportunity of visiting that city. The following people have this
opportunity: service personnel of the various types of passenger
and freight transportation; representatives and agents of trading
and manufacturing firms, insurance companies, and real-estate
offices; correspondents, etc.

The cut-out receives (from the agents) only such information
as is required for his work. As a rule, the names and addresses
of the case officer and agent are not given to the cut-out.

In communications via a live drop there is no personal
contact between the agent and the intelligence officer. Opera-
tional materials from the agent to the case officer, and vice
versa, are passed through a third person who more often than
not is the proprietor of a small private business (bookstores,
secondhand bookstores, antique stores, drugstores, etc.).

The case officer visits the live drop to receive materials only
after a special signal is given. The proprietor of the live drop
places the signal after receiving material from the agent.

[4] A “cut-out” is an agent or subordinate officer used as an intermediary
between the officer and an agent, to make surveillance more difficult.

## 2. Impersonal Communications

Under the. complex operating conditions existing in the
U.S.A. the primary type of agent communications is impersonal.
Experience has shown that this is the most secure type of
communication, because there is no direct contact between
agent and officer.

Impersonal communication is used to pass operational ma-
terials, to assign tasks, and to pass material -- technical supplies
--to the _rezidentura_ and individual agents.

It is used between the Center and a _rezidentura_, as well as
within a _rezidentura_.

The basic forms of impersonal communications are radio
communications, communications via dead drops, communica-
tions via postal-telegraph systems, telephone, press, and com-
mumcations via signals.

### Radio Communications with the _rezidentura_

Ultrashortwave (UHF) radio sets are used for communica-
tions within a _rezidentura_. These sets greatly improve the effi-
ciency of agent communications. The have a small operating
radius. Nevertheless, while on the air, accidental or intentional
radio monitoring is possible; and our intelligence service can
not afford to ignore this consideration. The use of specially
devised codes, ciphers, signal system, and operating schedule
makes the use of this set completely secure.Radio can be
used to call the agent for an emergency meeting, to tell him
when a dead drop has been loaded or unloaded, to notify him
about a change in dead drops, etc. UHF radio can also be
used within _rezidenturas_ to assign tasks to an agent and to
receive intelligence information from an agent. Radio com-
munications over UHF must be short.

There are many different ways of using a portable UHF set.
Following are only some of the uses:
. . . when the intelligence officer and the agent are traveling
along different streets;
. . . when the intelligence officer and the agent are driving in
different parts of the city;
. . . when the intelligence officer is in the city and is trans-
mitting while on the move, and the agent is receiving in his
apartment;
. . . when the intelligence officer is on shore, and the agent is
in a boat.

To have communications via UHF, one must set up a schedule
for radio communications. This schedule provides for a location
for each radio station, the precise time to start radio com-
munications (date, hour, and minute), which radio station will
begin transmitting first, and other details.

### Dead-Drop Communications

Dead drops are extensively used for communication within
a _rezidentura_, as well as for communications between the Center
and illegal _rezidenturas_, within agent nets, or with individual
agents.

The use of dead drops in communications with agents has
several advantages over personal meetings. Some of these ad-
vantages are: 
. . . dead—drop communications are safer as there is no direct
contact between the officer and agent;
. . . they are more secure, because the agent need not know
the intelligence officer with whom he is in contact via the dead
drop;
. . . by using a dead drop it is unnecessary for the intelligence
officer to have a good knowledge of the local language;
. . . when necessary, it is possible to replace or substitute one
intelligence officer with another;
. . . there is the possibility of wide flexibility in time.

The use of dead drops, however, is not without its draw-
backs. The dead drop is an intermediate link between the offi-
cer and agent, and materials placed in a dead drop are out-
side their control for a certain length of time. Therefore we
must reduce to a minimum the length of time during which
materials are located in a dead drop.

In Practice, Stationiary, portable, and mobile dead drops are
used.

Stationary dead drops are selected or specially prepared in
parks and squares, in trees, in the ground, in fences, in benches
in monuments, in public buildings, and beyond populated places
such as forests, fields, seashores, riverbanks, etc.

In selecting and preparing a dead drop in a park one must
bear in mine that a number of American parks (for example,
Central Park in New York ) have many squirrels which can
destroy the dead drop (especially in hollow trees) and carry off
our material.

As a rule, a dead drop is used only one time, after which a
different one is used. In the U.S.A. it is preferable to adopt
a system consisting of a series of dead drops for the agent and a
certain number for the case officer. One should work out a
schedule for using dead drops so that the agent will know the
dead drops to be used in January, those to be used in February,
etc. The schedule can be prepared for a half year or for a
full year, depending on the number available.

The use of portable dead drops is more worthy of consider-
ation because it is considerably easier to find places for them

We have no particular difficulty in finding places in American
cities which contain many discarded objects (boxes, tubes,
bottles, cans, match boxes, cigarette packs, paper, and others).
Often those objects lie around in plain sight for long periods
of time without arousing any interest. Among such objects,
which are of no use to anybody, and which can be found in
yards, in parks, etc., an intelligence officer may leave a similar
object with agent material concealed in it at a preselected place
to have it picked up later by another agent.

American household articles, medicines, and many other
articles are packaged in all kinds of boxes, cans, tubes, cases,
and made of cardboard, metal, and plastic. Hence there is an
extremely wide selection of packages which can be used as
portable dead drops.

Among the items which can be used as portable dead drops
and which can be prepared in advance are pieces of wood,
stone, brick, clay, cement, plastic, gypsum, and others.

Wide use can be made of magnetic containers in New York,
which has many metallic structures. They can be attached to
anything metal.[5]

In communication through a dead drop the agent receives
his assignments in written form. These agent assignments must
be encoded or enciphered. Also, the material itself must be in a
form suitable for passing through a dead drop. Therefore we
must train the agent in the use of ciphers, codes, the preparation
of soft emulsion film, microdot, and secret writing.

The technical knowledge of the average American is rather
high. In his everyday life he makes wide use of machines,
equipment, and instruments. Therefore the training of an Amer-
ican agent in operational technology is all the easier.

The types of signals and the places for posting them in con-
nection with dead-drop communications are the same as those
which were discussed in the [deleted] section “Characteristics
of Other Types of Meetings.” Here we need only to emphasize
the particular importance and convenience of radio in exchang-
ing signals.

The intelligence officer in the U.S.A. who has initiative and
imagination will be able to use dead drops frequently when
organizing agent communications.

One or two days prior to loading or unloading a dead drop,
the intelligence officer submits his plan for the operation to the
_rezident_ and receives his approval.

Several hours before the operation (no later than one and
a half to two hours) the intelligence officer travels to the city.
He uses the time available for a thorough check to determine
whether or not he is under surveillance. At the same time, he
checks a prearranged place for a danger signal if such arrange-
ments have been made. As a rule, the check for a danger
signal is made in an area other than the area where the dead
drop is located.

Having determined that he is not under surveillance and that
there is no danger signal, the intelligence officer goes to the
dead drop. In the immediate vicinity of the dead drop he must
once more confirm that conditions are right; then, without
losing any time, go to the dead drop, load (unload) it, and
proceed on the prescribed course.

On his return trip the intelligence officer can place his signal
that the dead drop has been loaded (unloaded).

[5] Use of such devices was cited by U.S. authorities in the 1958 spy trial of
the Soviet _rezident_ Colonel Rudolf Abel.


### The Clandestine Use of the Postal and Telegraph Systems

The American postal and telegraph system is highly de-
veloped.

The enormous stream of mail sent abroad, as well as that sent
inside the country, can be successfully used for intelligence
purposes both in peacetime and in war.

The postal and telegraph service is quite efficient, and letters
are rarely lost. Thus, we have favorable conditions for using
the postal and telegraph system in the interests of intelligence
in support of agent communications.

The postal and telegraph system is used to send concealed
intelligence messages. Intelligence messages must in no way
differ from an ordinary letter, either in superficial appearance
or in their overt contents.

To make effective use of the postal and telegraph system in
agent communications, we must learn everything concerning the
writing and sending of letters and telegrams. All this is espe-
cially important for the Illegal intelligence officer.

In the U.S.A. the name of the addressee is written first on the
envelope, then the house address and name of the street, and
finally the city and state.

Most business letters, and many personal letters as well, are
typewritten. Intelligence officers should also type their opera-
tional letters in order to conceal the handwriting of the sender.

There is a standard form for business letters. Samples of dif-
ferent letters can be found in the specially issued brochures
(letter-writing manual).

When making clandestine use of the postal and telegraph
system to send operational messages, we must make full use of
ciphers, codes, secret writing, and other means of concealing
the message being sent.

Because there is fierce competition among business firms in
the U.S.A., it is a usual practice to send enciphered messages
addressed both to business enterprises and to private individ-
uals. This helps the work of our intelligence officers in their use
of the postal and telegraph system for intelligence purposes.

To have effective agent communications via the postal and
telegraph system even in wartime, we must train the agent In
peacetime in the use of ciphers, codes, secret writing, and
microphotography, while providing him with accommodation
addresses. This is important also because there will be a tightening
of the censorship of the postal and telegraph system in time of
war.

There are different methods of organizing communications
with a _rezidentura_. _Rezidents_ receive correspondence from
agents either at their home address or at an accommodation
address. Correspondence to the agent can be sent to his home
address, to a hotel address, or to a post-office box rented by
the agent.


### Clandestine Use of the Telephone

The telephone is an integral part of the American way of life.
Many business and commercial affairs are transacted by tele-
phone. There are more than four million telephones in New
York alone. Besides private (personal) and office telephones,
there are also many public telephones. Typical of American
public telephones is that they have their own numbers and can
receive calls. This can be used in agent communications. For
example, on a predetermined date and time the intelligence
officer can talk from a public telephone with an agent who goes
to another previously specified public telephone at a prearranged
time. It (is preferable to select a telephone in a sparsely populated
area and use it during working hours when public telephones
are not busy. In addition, public telephones can also be used
as a signaling means.

The most convenient telephones for an intelligence officer to
use are those located in large department stores, subway sta-
tions, and drugstores.

One can also call other cities from a public telephone. To
make such a call, one dials the operator by depositing ten
cents and then gives the city and telephone number of the
person being called. In such a case, an additional sum is
needed which the operator will indicate; therefore the intel-
ligence officer should have with him one to one and a half
dollars in change.

If the circumstances are favorable, it is possible to use an
agent’s home or office telephone. In both cases the officer must
know the time and the days when the agent is at home and at
work, who might answer the phone, what the agent usually
discusses at that time, etc.

The U. S. counterintelligence service makes extensive use of
telephone tapping; therefore our intelligence officers under cover
rarely use the telephone and when they do, they do so covertly.

Telephone conversations must be short and well planned.
Special phrases (designating an emergency meeting or some-
thing else) must always be within the context of the conversa-
tion.

Experience shows that individual agents not infrequently for-
get the communications arrangements, resulting in a break
of the work routine. It is, therefore, advisable to check period-
ically the agent’s knowledge of individual parts of the com-
munications arrangements, including code words and their
meaning.

The following case can serve as an example. A code phrase
had been agreed upon to call an agent to a meeting from
another city. When the need arose, the intelligence officer called
the agent at work from a public telephone. The intelligence
officer identified himself by his code name and then gave the
code phrase, “My wife and I would like to thank you very much
for the gift you sent us for our family vacation.”

The bewildered agent asked, “Who? I? Sent a gift? What
gift?” The intelligence officer realized that the agent had for-
gotten the communications arrangements. He then calmly re-
peated his name (code name), then asked, “Apparently you
didn’t recognize me?” He repeated the code phrase once more.
This time the agent understood. He shouted happily into the
receiver, “Excuse me, my dear friend, I didn’t recognize you
at first. I’m very glad that you both were pleased with my modest
gift.” A week later the agent appeared for the emergency meet-
ing.

It is an American custom to spell out difficult words, es-
pecially surnames. (In the U.S.A., the word is first spelled and
then, as in England, pronounced.) Our intelligence officer, es-
pecially the illegal intelligence officer, must be able to spell out
loud; he must be able to spell any word quickly and un-
hesitatingly. This is perfected through training. One must pre-
pare a telephone conversation very carefully so that neither the
context of the conversation nor the speaker’s accent arouses the
suspicions of an outsider.

If one plans to use a telephone when organizing agent com-
munications, he must give serious consideration to the use of a
cut-out telephone.

As a rule, a cut-out telephone is called from a public tele-
phone. Such conversations are in code and should correspond
to the cut-out telephone owner’s work so that they will not
vary in the least from the owner's daily telephone conversations.
Signals can be given over the telephone (by voice or by rings).
In transmitting signals over the telephone, we must pay careful
attention to the time set for the signal; the time of day, code
phrases, and the number of rings should be changed frequently.

The case officer plans the arrangements for telephone com-
munications, as well as the code, taking into consideration the
agent’s suggestions.


### The Use of the Press and a Signaling System

The U.S.A. has up to two thousand daily newspapers with a
circulation of about fifty-seven million, and more than seven
thousand magazines. Both newspapers and magazines give con-
siderable space to advertisements and all kinds of announce-
ments. Newspaper companies receive sizable profits from adver-
tisements and announcements and therefore accept them very
readily.

For example, in 1958, readers paid a total of one to one and
a half billion dollars for newspapers, while representatives of
financial and industrial circles paid out more than three billion
dollars for advertising. Thus, publishing houses receive several
times more in profits from advertisements and announcements
than they do from the sale of newspapers.

Advertisements published in American newspapers differ
greatly in content and in length. The most common ones deal
with the sale and rental of living quarters, the sale of personal
effects, employment opportunities, announcements of weddings,
divorces, births, and deaths, the loss of valuables and pets, etc.

Below are several samples of advertisements which could be
used in intelligence work. [Following samples appear in Eng-
lish.]

		POSITION WANTED

	Housework—Mature Colombian maid speaking a little English
	will give considerable care to children or an old lady; do effi-
	cient general housework. $25-$30 per wk. Exeter 4-0432,
	7-10 P.M.

		DOMESTIC EMPLOYMENT

	Chauffeur, white——wanted. Age 35 married. 12 years exp. In-
	telligent alert neat. Fordham 4-7457 before noon.

		PUBLIC NOTICES AND COMMERCIAL NOTICES
	My wife, Jane Smith Doe, has left my bed and board. I am no
	longer responsible for her debts. John Doe, 17 Leshe Lane,
	Dobbs Ferry, New York.

		LOST AND FOUND
	Briefcase left in taxi Wednesday afternoon I an. 4th travell-
	ing Idlewild Airport to 1506 Woodslde Avenue, New Yor .
	Reward Dunhill 4-0892, ext. 534.

		CATS, DOGS AND BIRDS

	Poodle tiny white. Lost in Queens, New Years Day- Answers
	to the name “Tiny.” $250 reward. Humboldt 6-9016

One can see from these examples that many advertisements
can be adapted quite easily to the transmittal of information.
Among the code words which can be used are: the names or
description of a lost article; a description of the circumstances;
the place and time it was lost; the size of the reward for return-
ing the valuable or pet; etc.

Illegal _rezidenturas_ have a greater opportunity to make use
of the press in arranging agent communications. _Rezidenturas_
under cover may use the press on a lesser scale, primarily to
transmit information or signals from agent to intelligence officer.
On the whole, the U.S.A. presents favorable conditions for the
use of the press for intelligence work.

A sum of money is paid to place an advertisement or some
kind of announcement in the press. The text of these advertise-
ments will contain a prearranged coded secret message.

In arranging communications involving the use of the press,
it is necessary to specify the particular newspaper or magazine
in which the coded intelligence information will appear, the
approximate dates of publication, and the form of the cor-
respondence (advertisement, announcement, etc.)

Coded announcements in the press can serve as a means of
communications not only within a _rezidentura_, but also with the
Center. In communicating with the Center, the major news-
papers which are sent abroad should be used (The New York
Times, New York Herald Tribune, and others). Within a rez-
identura, however, it is better to use small local newspapers be-
cause there is less likelihood of censorship over them and be-
cause it is simpler to place announcements in them.

As a rule, signaling plays an auxiliary role in organizing com-
munications. When using dead drops and when holding personal
meetings and recognition meetings, intelligence officers use sig-
naling a great deal.

Signals should be varied as much as possible. We must also
make sure that the signals are natural and do not attract the
attention of an outsider. They must be sufficiently legible and
precise to preclude any misinterpretation.

Agents must exchange signals at a distance while in sight of
each other. Various objects may be used for this (handkerchief,
gloves, cigarettes), as well as a certain color of clothing and
other means.

Signals can also be given by specially constructed technical
means. To transmit infrared signals not visible to the eye, a
pocket ffashlight equipped with a special infrared light filter can
be used. Infrared signals are received with the binoculars
“B-I-8,” which have a special “phosphorus” element for this
purpose that changes invisible infrared rays into visible ones.

Signals may be transmitted by an announcement in the local
press or by postcard, letter, or telegram.

Lastly, sound signals can be sent by radio or telephone.

Thus, signals can be subdivided into graphic, object, light,
sound, and personal signals.

Graphic signals are prearranged marks. in the form of geo-
metric figures, lines, letters, ciphers, etc., written in pencil,
chalk, nail, or some other sharp object in a specific, prear-
ranged place.

Object signals are various small objects put in a specific, pre-
arranged place. The object itself may serve as a signal; as can
its position; or the object and its position together may be a
signal.

A thorough study of the specific features of the country en-
ables one to select the most natural signals. For example one
of our intelligence officers called an agent for an introductory
meeting by sending the newspaper Washington Daily News to
his apartment. The intelligence oificer went to the city, made
a careful check, and then called the newspaper office from a
public telephone and asked them to start delivery on the next
day to the address he gave them (the agent’s address). A week
after delivery started, the agent appeared at the prearranged
meeting place. Signals can also be made by sending the agent
books, magazines, or merchandise from se1f—service stores (mar-
kets) where it is the practice to deliver these things to the home.

A large variety of signals allows great diversification in the
use of signals and prevents patterns. Certain signals (graphic
and object) are used with dead drops; others (light signals, and
sound signals transmitted by phone or radio) are used to call
an agent for a meeting and to warn of danger. The third group
(signals given by radio and signals given through the mails or
press) is used for communicating with the Center or with an
agent living in another city.

Thus, the selection of signals and the methods for their trans-
mission depend on the circumstances, the tasks, and the opera-
tional situation.

## Nature of the Organization of Direct
## Agent Communications between the Center and
## Intelligence Organs in the U.S.A.

The U.S.A. is not only a great distance away from the Soviet
Union, but it is also located in another hemisphere. This com-
plicates the systematization of direct communications between
the Center and the American _rezidenturas_. This is the principal
characteristic influencing the organization of direct agent com-
munications.

We must, however, maintain regular communications be-
tween the Center and the _rezidenturas_ in both peace and war.

We have three types of direct communications between the
Center and _rezidenturas_: radio communications, courier commu-
n1cations, and communications through the use of the postal-
telegraph system. A brief description of each type follows be-
low.

### Organization and Implementation of Agent Communications in Peacetime

#### RADIO COMMUNICATIONS

Radio communications provide the most rapid means for
transmitting orders and instructions from the Center to rezi-
denturas and for sending reports from _rezidenturas_ to the Center.

Every Illegal _rezidentura_ must train a radio operator and then
properly legalize him. It must also get in advance the latest radio
equipment (from the Center) and check its operation. This
must be done even now, in peacetime.

Because of our distance from the U.S.A., should the need
arise, we can set up radio relay stations which can be located
on shlps, submarines, and aircraft. We also must not exclude
the possibility that in the not too distant future we can install
a radio station on an earth satellite.

For successful maintenance of radio communications between
the Center and _rezidenturas_, we must work continuously to im-
prove high-speed radio equipment with long operating ranges.

The broad introduction of radio electronic equipment and the
large number of specialists in this field facilitate our work of
selecting, training, and legalizing radio operators.

The Center can use our broadcasting stations to transmit in-
structions to _rezidenturas_ by coded signals. Such signals must be
planned in advance and given to _rezidenturas_.

For communications from the Center to Illegal _rezidenturas_
widespread use is made of one-way radio communications sent
by the Center by way of enciphered radiograms, signals, and
prearranged phrases.

The Illegal intelligence officer is given an operational code
and a schedule of one-way radio transmissions in which are in-
dicated the date, time, and frequencies of the radio broadcasts.

The intelligence officer may acquire a radio receiver locally
with a shortwave band, to receive coded W/T messages. Own-
ership of such a receiver by the intelligence officer arouses no
suspicion whatsoever in the U.S.A. There is no registration of
radio and television sets in the U.S.A., nor is there a fee
charged for their use. The radio operator receives one-way ra-
dio broadcasts from the Center in his own apartment.

Radio-operating conditions in a country may change, de-
pending on internal conditions and international relations.
Therefore every intelligence officer must constantly study these
conditions carefully and promptly report any changes to the
Center.

#### COURIER COMMUNICATIONS

The great progress in aircraft construction and shipbuilding,
and the expanded network of air and sea communication routes
between the U.S.A., and other countries of the world, most of
all between the U.S.A. and European countries—on which
hundreds of thousands of passengers and thousands of tons of
freight which are carried yearly, facilitate our organization of
Illegal courier communications.

In organizing Illegal courier communications in peacetime
between the Center and _rezidenturas_ in the U.S.A., great assis-
tance can be furnished by the _rezidenturas_ under cover. The
Center sends mail (currency, documents, operational equip-
ment, etc.) to the _rezidenturas_ under cover by diplomatic pouch.
The _rezidenturas_ under cover then transfer materials to Illegal
_rezidenturas_ through the Center’s dead drop. Any materials for
the Center from Illegal _rezidenturas_ are recovered from dead
drops by operatives of the _rezidenturas_ under cover and are sent
to the Center by diplomatic pouch. Such an organization of
communications, however, does not guarantee clandestinity and
security. This is particularly true of the U.S.A., where our in-
telligence officers working under cover in Soviet installations are
kept under strict surveillance by the counterintelligence service.

Therefore, even in peacetime we must organize and use Il-
legal courier communications which are capable of functioning
efficiently in wartime.

The quick delivery of materials is vital. Therefore, when
organizing courier communications, it is advisable to use the
airlines between the U.S.A. and Europe.

The U.S.A. has air communications not only with the NATO
countries (Denmark, Norway, England, France, Iceland, Italy,
Turkey, the Benelux countries, Portugal, West Germany) but
also with the neutral countries (Sweden, Austria, Switzerland).
This facilitates the selection of itineraries for the Center’s cou-
riers.

The aircrews of the airlines know the operating conditions
at the airports well. They should be used as couriers--also
ground crew personnel who can deliver material from the U.S.A.
to one of the countries of Europe (and from Europe to the
U.S.A.) with the help of mobile dead drops in aircraft.

Steamship companies which maintain service between the
U.S.A. and Europe can also be used to conduct courier com-
munications between the Center and _rezidenturas_ in the U.S.A.

#### USE OF POSTAL AND TELEGRAPH SYSTEMS

Communications with Illegal intelligence officers are main-
tained through the use of the postal-telegraph system. All postal
correspondence is sent only to specific addresses. Therefore the
Illegal intelligence officer is provided with accommodation ad-
dresses (primary and alternate) to which he writes letters in-
tended for the Center.

While the Illegal intelligence officer does not have an address,
the Center can send letters to him addressed to the hotel where
he is planning to stay or where he had stayed. After renting
an apartment the Illegal officer is in a position to receive cor-
respondence at his place of residence. He must immediately
send his address to the Center, and he must do this in at least
two or three letters.

The mails can be used as a way to deliver graphic and object
signals. The following can denote signals: sending a certain let-
ter; the color and size of the envelope or paper; the cost or
number of stamps; the nature of the letter; the kind of saluta-
tion; the signature; etc. The signal must look natural and not
attract the attention of postal employees or censors. This is im-
portant because the letters containing signals go through the
usual postal channels.

### Organization and Use of Agent Communications in Wartime

### RADIO COMMUNICATIONS

In time of war, the main type of communication between the
Center and individual Illegal intelligence officers and _rezidenturas_
can be two-way radio communications.

We must remember that in wartime the conditions for main-
tenance of direct communications between the Center and rez-
identuras will be considerably more difficult. The search for Il-
legal radio stations will be intensified; there will be interruptions
in the power supply; there will be fewer opportunities to obtain
radio spare parts locally; and there will be less power.

To ensure reliable wartime communications during peacetime
we must provide for the following:

1) reserves of radio sets and parts (and providing for reliable
and long safekeeping);

2) storage batteries for radio sets;

3) selection of alternate apartments for radio operations;

4) timely evacuation of radio equipment from large industrial
centers which could be hit by missile strikes;

5) supplying _rezidenturas_ with radio operators in case the latter
are mobilized or given special assignments.

Modern agent radio communications, with high-speed equip-
ment and separate installations for two-way and one-way com-
munications, reduces to a minimum the operating time of an
Illegal radio station. At the same time, this almost completely
precludes its being located by counterintelligence direction find-
ing.

In wartime we must conduct continuous monitoring for in-
dividual radio-equipped sources, agent nets, and _rezidenturas_ on
assigned frequencies for high-speed equipment.

#### COURIER COMMUNICATIONS

In wartime, Illegal couriers cannot be replaced, because they
are the only means that can be used to send documents, materi-
als, and technical means. Therefore their organization calls for
special preparation.

Experience has shown that in wartime the possibilities for
using civilian aviation and ocean liners for courier purposes
are reduced; fewer passengers travel to and from Europe; customs
inspections are stricter; and it is much more difficult to pro-
vide cover stories for travel abroad by a foreign courier (from
Europe to the U.S.A., and return).

In the inspection of baggage the customs service in the
U.S.A. makes extensive use of the latest achievements in sci-
ence and technology. Not long ago, the chief of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, Edgar Hoover, proposed the use of
X-rays to screen baggage transported in aircraft.[6]

For couriers between the Center and Illegal _rezidenturas_ in
wartime, it is better to use the crews of ships and of civilian
and military aircraft. We should therefore try to have agents on
steamships (among officers, seamen, stevedores, cooks), on air-
craft (among the crew members), at airports, and in the offices
of steamship companies.

In the recruitment of agents preference should be given to
Americans because they are highly trusted both in the U.S.A.
and in the countries of Europe. It is much easier for an Ameri-
can agent to deliver mail for the Center from the U.S.A. to
one of the West European countries (neutral countries or an
ally of the U.S.A.) and mail to _rezidenturas_ in the U.S.A.

We must not exclude the possibility of getting a courier to
the American mainland by submarine. It must be remembered,
however, that the U.S.A.’s shore defenses. are stronger than those
of other countries of the American continent. Therefore one
should not always attempt to land an agent directly in the U.S.A.

At times it is possible to send mail to a third country (for ex-
ample, Mexico) and then deliver it overland to the U.S.A. Mail
sent in this manner can be placed in the Center’s dead drops.

To ensure stable courier communications in wartime we must
provide in advance for the replacement of couriers who might
be called into service and select individuals who for some rea-
son (because of age or health) will not be subject to military
mobilization.

[6] “The New York Times, April 2, 1960.

### Use of the Postal and Telegraph Services

With the outbreak of hostilities, censorship will be tightened
and a number of restrictions may be adopted in connection with
postal and telegraph correspondence. During World War II
the U.S. censor checked practically all correspondence going
abroad, making broad use of special chemical reagents to test
for secret writing.

Without changing the over-all meaning, the censor is per-
mitted to alter the word order of telegrams and strike out words
or entire phrases in letters.

The purpose of all these measures is to hinder the activities
of foreign intelligence services. Neither the U.S.A. nor any other
country, however, has the censorship capability to subject all
a postal and telegraph correspondence to control.

In our opinion, business correspondence between American
and foreign firms will continue in time of war. Many American
firms specialize in selling merchandise imported from other
countries. For example, some firms sell British woolens in the
U.S.A., others sell West German radios, while still others sell
Swiss items, etc. Business, therefore, compels these firms to
maintain communications, including postal and telegraph, with
their overseas suppliers.

Therefore accommodation addresses should be acquired even
in peacetime, based on American organizations and enterprises
which will maintain business correspondence with foreign gov-
ernments even in time of war. They can then be effectively used
during wartime.

# II. HANDLING AN AGENT NET

In this section we shall examine only some of the problems
concerning agent handling; and specifically:
. . . ensuring the completion of the principal intelligence tasks;
. . . ensuring clandestinity of agent net operations;
. . . ensuring a state of readiness in an agent net;
. . . consolidating agents in intelligence nets.

## 1. Fulfillment of the Principal Intelligence Tasks

## Definition of the Basic Intelligence Tasks and Directing
## Agent Nets for Their Fulfillment

Intelligence tasks of strategic agent intelligence are defined by
the General Staff of the Soviet Army.

Under modern conditions, when the U.S.A., as the principal
imperialist power, is preparing to unleash a surprise war with
the mass employment of nuclear/missile weapons, the basic
tasks of strategic agent intelligence are the early warning of
U.S. preparations for an armed attack against the U.S.S.R. and
other socialist countries and the report of this to Headquarters.
In view of the probable nature of a future war, an important
task is the systematic collection of the most complete data on
the following questions:

 1) the locations of missile bases, depots for nuclear weapons,
 plants producing atomic weapons and missiles of various desig-
 nations, scientific research institutes, and laboratories develop-
 ing and perfecting weapons of mass destruction;

 2) information as to the nature and results of scientific re-
 search work in creating new models of nuclear and missile
 weapons and improving existing ones;

 3) the status of antiaircraft defense, including. the entire radar
 detection and warning system;

 4) the plans of U.S. military commanders on the use of nuclear /
 missile weapons;

 5) U.S. military preparations in the various theaters of opera-
 tions.

Strategic agent intelligence in the U.S.A. must learn of prep-
arations for a surprise attack against the U.S.S.R. and other
countries in the socialist camp and warn Moscow of it. That is
its primary task.

To assure the further strengthening of the defensive power
of the Soviet government, we depend to a large extent on the
successful fulfillment of the tasks levied on the intelligence or-
gans in the U.S.A.

During a crisis period, intelligence efforts must be directed
toward the prompt disclosure of the enemy’s immediate prep-
arations for attack and the reporting of his grouping of forces
and means, primarily his means of nuclear attack. The most im-
portant task of intelligence is the prompt reporting of objectives
in the U.S.A against Which We plan to carry out the first strikes.

### Assignment of Targets to Agent Nets

We must assign targets to agent nets in accordance with the
basic intelligence tasks and the operational capabilities of the
agents. First of all, we must have agent nets in those govern-
ment installations possessing the most complete, authentic infor-
matron on matters of intelligence interest, primarily data on mili-
tary planning. The following organs of the supreme military
command are in this category:
National Security Council, Department of Defense, Armed
Forces Policy Co-ordinating Council, Joint Chiefs of Staff, De-
partments of the Army, Air Force, and Navy and their staffs,
and the Strategic Air Command.

It is vital to introduce agents in those targets where it is pos-
srble to obtain data on the work of enterprises producing nu-
clear and other weapons of mass destruction. Such targets are:

1) Atomic Energy Commission (includes twelve departments
and ten operations groups, co-ordinating the majority of atomic
plants, laboratories, and testing stations);

2) Joint Congressional Atomic Energy Committee;

3) Specially-created Department for the Construction of Atomic
Installations; ,

4) Military Co-ordinating Committee of the Department of De-
fense;

5) Bureau of Atomic Energy of the Department of the Navy.

The following centers for the production of nuclear fuel are
of great intelligence interest: Oak Ridge (Tennessee), Hanford
(Washington), Paducah (Kentucky), and others. One of the
largest centers for the production of atomic weapons is Los
Alamos (New Mexico).

## 2. Establishment of Clandestine Agent Net Operations; Trans-
## fer of Agent Nets to Impersonal Types of Communication

As has been mentioned, in the U.S.A., under conditions of
severe counterintelligence activity, impersonal forms of com-
munications constitute the basic method of communication, be-
cause they provide the greatest degree of security and clandes-
tinity in the conduct of clandestine operations. The intelligence
officer’s task is to train his agents properly and to transfer them
to impersonal forms of communication promptly. Before con-
verting an agent to working through dead drops, as one of the
forms of impersonal communications, the intelligence officer
must train the agent in the use of dead drops and in the use of
signals.

Initially the agent will not trust the reliability of dead drops
and will be reluctant to place classified materials in them. The
agent can be convinced of the reliability of dead drops gradu-
ally, for example, by first placing money in it for him if he is
it being paid for his work.  

An example proves this point. For a long time Agent S was
reluctant to work via dead drops. The intelligence officer’s at-
tempts to convince S of the security of working via dead drops
were completely unsuccessful. Then the intelligence officer clev-
erly began placing money in the dead drop for the agent. The
first time S came to the dead drop ahead of the case officer
and watched him place the money in it. As soon as the case
officer had gone a short distance from the dead drop, the agent
ran up to the dead drop and removed the money. The second
time, the agent removed the money more calmly. Gradually he
began to trust the dead drop as a form of clandestine com-
munication and was no longer afraid to place operational ma-
terials in it.

Transfer of an agent to impersonal communications requires
the case officer to be considerably more careful than when main-
taining personal communications. He must instruct the agent
thoroughly in such matters as the modus operandi of the counter-
intelligence service, adherence to proper operational techniques
in agent operations, etc.

### Briefing of Agents and Indoctrinating Them in Conspiracy

Conspiracy in agent operations is directly dependent on the
indoctrination of the agent and on the skill and efficiency with
which the officer conducts his briefing. The officer must brief
the agent on specific points, keeping in mind the main objec-
tives: to provide assistance, to demonstrate how to fulfill his
assigned task better and more securely, to help correct mistakes
he has committed or eliminate shortcomings, and to teach him
the qualities required in clandestine operations and in intelli-
gence. It should be emphasized that the national characteristics
of American agents are such that they are often careless in
their operations and they make poor conspirators. They there-
fore need extremely careful briefing.

A good case officer always attempts to be authoritative in
the agent’s eyes. Precise, businesslike briefings are very impor-
tant in earning respect.

The agent should be briefed very carefully on how to behave
properly in front of his family, at work, and in public. When
necessary, the intelligence officer must brief the agent on how
to smuggle material out of an installation, how to return it un-
detected, and how to reproduce the material at home or at work.
It is very important that the agent know how to develop a
proper and plausible cover story for his extra income and for
his periodic absences. Depending on his assignments, the agent
is given certain information on the work of the counterintel1i-
gence service. In briefing the agent on this subject, the officer
must not frighten the agent with any exaggerations.

The officer is forbidden to use special Soviet intelligence ter-
minology in briefing his agents or to reveal intelligence operating
techniques.


# 3. Providing a State of Readiness in an Agent Net

## Training of Agents and Agent Nets for Independent
## Communications with the Center

It is obvious that the operating conditions of a _rezidentura_ will
change in time of war. From previous experience, the _rezidentura_
under cover will stop operations as soon as official Soviet in-
stallations are closed. Therefore one of the most important tasks
of a _rezidentura_ under official cover during peacetime is to train
agents and prepare agent nets to maintain independent com-
munications with the Center for operation during wartime. Such
training is very complex and includes the following:

Training the agent to operate radio sets; providing him with
a radio set; setting up a reserve radio set in case the agent’s radio
breaks down, and against this eventuality securing an independent
power supply; supplying reliable and long-time safekeeping of
all radio equipment; renting safe apartments for operational ra-
dio communications; carrying out trial runs of radio nets in
peacetime in order to keep radio operators in reserve and sys-
tematically to check the combat readiness of the equipment.
Arranging special reserves of currency and articles of value;
establishing permanent recognition meetings in two or three
countries which will permit contact to be made with the Cen-
ter’s couriers; acquiring accommodation addresses, and putting
them to use promptly.

Training programs providing for independent communica-
tion with the Center must give both the individual agent and
principal agent detailed instructions on the problems of orga-
nizing and conducting intelligence operations, but only to the
degree necessary for them to carry out the work specifically as-
signed to them. They are made familiar with some of the operat-
ing procedures of the counterintelligence service vis—a-vis intelli-
gence targets. During training the case officer devotes particular
attention to making sure that they are thoroughly briefed and
indoctrinated.

The Center makes the decision to transfer an agent or an
agent group to a status of independent communications. The
intelligence officer handling the agent gives the Center all in-
formation necessary to make such a decision. Therefore it is
the intelligence officer’s responsibility to know the agent and,
above all, his operational capabilities, his political orientation,
and his feelings toward the U.S.S.R. We should note that some
intelligence officers try too hard to learn everything about an
agent in one meeting. This immediately puts the agent on his
guard. Studying an agent should involve a systematic, planned,
and gradual acquisition of information concerning him. In view
of the fact that individual agents react very adversely to attempts
by the intelligence officer to learn specific pieces of information
about them, the officer must prepare very carefully for every
meeting with an agent.

Finally, we need to have preliminary talks with every agent
scheduled to be assigned to an agent net to get his agreement
to continue working under the guidance of a local person (prin-
cipal agent).

### Location of Agent Nets in a Future War

In a future war, despite the irreconcilable contradictions be-
tween the capitalist and socialist countries, both sides will pur-
sue the same political and military objectives.

To protect their socialist achievements the Soviet Union and
other countries in the socialist camp will be forced to fight for
the complete defeat of the enemy’s armed forces and the dis-
organization of his rear area. We anticipate that in order to
frustrate the plans of the U.S.A., if it should unleash a war,
mass missile strikes will be launched against the most important
enemy objectives, including the deep rear. We can assume that
in a war which will see the mass employment of the most mod-
em and destructive means of war, including nuclear missiles,
the borderline between front and rear disappears.

Under modern conditions, therefore, agent nets must be lo-
cated in new locations, with consideration given to the nature
of a future war. To save valuable agents in wartime, we must
disperse the agent net over the entire country, preferably in
small cities which do not represent important targets for nuclear /
missile strikes. With the advent of a crisis we must take steps
for the prompt movement of agents, if this has not been done
earlier, away from targets for nuclear strikes. In view of these
new conditions _rezidenturas_ and agent nets must be small. In
special cases, individual agents can be equipped with radios for
direct communications with the Center to report on such targets
as nuclear weapon depots and missile and other military bases.

# 4. Consolidation of Agents in Intelligence Nets

## Methods of Incentive and Coercion

One of the means of consolidating agents in an intelligence
net is the proper, use of the measures of incentive and coercion.
The use of either measure depends on the actions and deeds of
the agent. Therefore the case officer’s first responsibility is to
have a thorough knowledge of the agent, because only in this
way can he properly assess the agent’s work and skillfully take
it appropriate measures in order to control the agent. The intelli-
gence officer who knows the national traits of Americans should
be able to establish rapport quickly with the agent and posi-
tively influence him.

For example, knowing that Americans do not like discipline
and are always demonstrating their independence, the intelli-
gence officer must refrain from resorting to obvious pressure on
the agent. One should not burden the agent with decisions, but
should skillfully encourage and direct intelligent initiative on
the part of the agent.

As we know, Americans are distinguished by their efficiency
and resourcefulness. Therefore the intelligence officer must ex-
hibit a high degree of precision and efficiency in working with
American agents, respond quickly to their reports, and provide
intelligent instructions and orders.

Americans have a great love of money and a desire for finan-
cial gain. This American trait can be exploited by paying an
agent for his work in order to increase his personal interest in
working for us. Payments must be prompt and equitable. This
disciplines the agent and improves the case officer’s authority.

As we know, all measures employed in influencing an agent
are divided into those which are moral and those which are
material. Material measures are primarily used with agents re-
cruited on a material and financial basis, while moral measures
are used with agents recruited on an ideological basis.

A similar distinction is made between incentive and coercive
measures.

Among the incentive measures are: praise of the agent’s
work by the case officer, statements of appreciation to the agent,
gifts to the agent, and the transfer of more valuable and deserv-
ing agents from piecework payment to a regular salary.

Among the coercive measures are: noting shortcomings in the
agent’s work, reducing his salary, suspending his salary for a
definite period of time, using threats (employed in extreme
cases).

[EDITOR'S NOTE: One page of text is missing here. In the
following passage, the lecturer continues his discussion of
American living conditions.]

We must bear in mind the standard of living in the country and
the agent’s ability to provide a cover for the receipt of additional
funds. As we know, the standard of living in the U.S.A. is quite
high. A qualified industrial worker, for example, earns about
four hundred dollars a month, which is several times higher
than workers earn in European countries.

In our practice, agents are usually paid by the job, money is
paid for each specific piece of material and according to its
value. With this system of payment, an agent quickly realizes
the necessity for conscientious work.

A system of payments by the month and by the job also in-
duces the agent to make the fullest use of his operational capa-
bilities. Under the system of material inducement an agent who
is working poorly can have his monthly payments reduced or
stopped. To encourage an agent, monthly payments are in-
creased or bonuses, awards, or valuable gifts are given.
Thus, for example, Agent B, who was on a monthly salary,
reduced his production appreciably. His attendance at meetings
and visits to dead drops were irregular. Despite rebukes by the
intelligence officer, the agent’s work did not improve.

The intelligence officer decided that he would have to use
material inducement. With the Center’s permission he began to
pay the agent only for those months during which the agent
actually worked and performed his operational activities. Soon
B realized that further backsliding would result only in the loss
of all his extra income. He began to perform his tasks more
efficiently. As a result regular communications with him were
now possible.

Payments are used both as an additional inducement to work
and as a reinforcement of the ideological motivation of an
agent.

## How to Use the Basic National Traits and the Customs,
## Habits, and Way of Life of Americans in Agent Handling

In the U.S.A. people from various strata of society have their
habits, customs, and standards which frequently become
unwritten laws.

The intelligence officer who knows all these characteristics
well will have a greater understanding of the American agent
and his actions. This understanding is vital for effective agent
handling and indoctrination.

Realizing that the majority of Americans are open, straight-
forward, and happy people with a great sense of humor, the in-
telligence officer can prepare for and conduct a conversation
with an agent that is not dull but lively and witty. When pre-
paring for a meeting he must try to anticipate the agent’s ques-
tions, prepare good answers to them, and at the meeting to an-
swer the agent in such a manner that the agent will feel that
the intelligence officer is being frank with him.

During a meeting questions may arise which require a deci-
sion by the _rezident_. The officer must know how to evade such
questions at the meeting without showing his lack of authority
in this.

A proper regard for these American characteristics will help
the intelligence officer to win over the agent. As is known, a
frank conversation is the best way of learning the agent’s politi-
cal orientation and his biography.

Americans, like other people, are patriots. They are proud
of their country’s achievements; they honor their national he-
roes, and value their cultural monuments. Therefore the intelli-
gence officer must be careful not to indiscriminately criticize
things American, but must remember that an unfortunate state-
ment, for example, about some popular U. S. President (George
Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson) might of-
fend the agent. A negative result might also come from an offi-
cer’s underrating American culture.

The officer can skillfully put to use such American traits as
efficiency, resourcefulness, boldness, and perseverance. These
will help the agent to carry out operational tasks and to exploit
his operational capabilities fully.

Americans, to a larger degree than representatives of many
other peoples, have a natural love of freedom and independence,
and do not like discipline. The officer must respect this charac-
teristic and not resort to open pressure on the agent. He must
not assign tasks rudely but must skillfully direct the agent’s
work and praise his intelligent initiative. He must not order the
agent around. An officious tone of voice by the officer will just
antagonize the agent.

An officer, especially a beginner, who does not know English
well must be very careful of what he says and not use such un-
fortunate expressions as, “I order,” “You must,” etc. Such ex-
pressions usually evoke a negative reaction.

As we have said before, Americans have a strong desire to
make extra money, to get rich. This characteristic can and must
be taken into consideration when carrying out the task of con-
solidating agents in an agent net.

A thorough understanding of the national characteristics of
Americans, as well as other traits, will help the consolidation of
agents into agent nets, allow the fuller use of their operational
capabilities, permit their thorough indoctrination, and increase
the officer’s authority.

# CONCLUSIONS

The basic principles of organizing agent communications and
agent handling, which have been accumulated and verified
through many years of experience in Soviet strategic agent in-
telligence, may be applied to all _rezidenturas_ regardless of the
country, be it the U.S.A. or some other country.

Therefore, the characteristics of agent communications and
handling in the U.S.A., are governed not merely by these princi-
ples but also by the proper and thorough regard for the operating
conditions in the country and by the consideration of the national
traits of Americans, their way of life, their customs and habits.
They are also conditioned by the role played by the U.S.A. in
aggressive military blocs and by the country’s geographic loca-
tion.

In this training material we have examined only some of the
characteristics which exist in the country at the present time.
We must keep them constantly in mind in working with agents.

It is necessary, however, to keep something else in mind: each
year sees many changes in people’s lives. Old buildings and en-
tire city blocks disappear, to be replaced by new buildings and
parks. Libraries will be filled with new books, new movies. will
appear, and people will acquire new customs and different
tastes. Technology will develop rapidly. In the U.S.A., a highly
industrialized power, these changes will occur to a greater ex-
tent than in other countries. Therefore the job of every officer
is to seek and consider all such changes which might exert an
influence on the organization of agent communications and
handling.

The intelligence officer must be prepared to make indepen-
dent decisions on operational matters during practical work.
The degree to which he is able to consider the characteristics of
the country, a specific city, the American people, and finally, of
a specific person, an agent, will determine the extent to which
he learns and acts properly and the extent to which he will be
successful in his handling of agents.

The difficult but very absorbing work of organizing agent
communications and handling demands that the officer apply all
his strength and energy to this task. He must seek constantly
new ways of finding solutions to operational questions.
