Rules of behavior (excerpt) 1974 

CLANDESTINITY: 
Cladestinity is an indispensable condition for the survival of a politico-military organization operating within the imperialist metropolises. The condition of clandestinity does not prevent the organization from taking place along lines within the forces of the workers' autonomy area. In addition to the condition of absolute clandestinity, therefore, in our experience, a second condition arises in which the militant, while belonging to the organization, operates in the movement, and is therefore forced to appear and move in the political forms that the movement assumes legally. This second type of clandestine militancy from a political point of view is the basis for the construction of the articulations of revolutionary power; from a military point of view it is the foundation of the development of workers' and popular militias. Operating from hiding gives an advantage decisive tactician on the enemy said that he lives exposed instead in his men and in the installations. This advantage is canceled when clandestinity is understood in a purely defensive sense. The defensive conception of clandestinity implies or hides the illusion that the clash between bog class and proletariat is ultimately played on the political terrain rather than on that of war, that is, that the military aspects are basically only supportive tactical aspects. The political work of each comrade takes place within a column. All political relations must therefore be monitored and evaluated. [...] You should never go on a date or do a particular job without someone else in the organization knowing about it. In particular, for contacts with new external elements, a prior discussion with the column managers is necessary. It is also necessary to discuss the need to put in place security measures appropriate to the case. Every contact it must be regulated in a predetermined way. In the event that you miss an appointment, another one for permanent recovery must be automatically set. This rule can be used as a security measure, especially if a relationship is not yet fully verified. You can purposely skip an appointment and send a buddy to patrol the area. The places of the appointments must therefore be previously studied and known in detail. Each place must have the following characteristics: be controllable and allow for a possible checked and prepared retreat. drive with extreme caution and total compliance with the highway code. It is necessary to arrive a little in advance for the appointments to be able to patrol the area and to avoid being seen with your car parked bearing in mind the possibility of an escape. Each militant must have his meeting places. It's part of his job. It is also necessary to avoid repeating appointments in the same places or at least varying them frequently. Public parks, very crowded places, near banks or militarized institutions, should be avoided. It is preferable to avoid the more militarized centers and meet in the hinterland. 

NOTES: 
1. They are not taken if they concern the organization and its life: they are memorized. 
2. They are valid for all general analyzes, avoiding to indicate names, places, decisive situations. 
3. Don't forget them, don't take them with you into action. 
4. lend them only in case of real need. 
5. No addresses or telephone numbers must be included. 

TALKING: 
1. Avoid discussions on the life of the organization - even with comrades - outside the appropriate locations. 
2. In public places, when you are among companions, you avoid pre or post meetings: this especially in the vicinity of the offices. 
3. Assume that all telephones are controlled and therefore limit them use for short communications. 

CARS: 
Even the car is an asset that the organization gives to the companion. He is therefore responsible for its maintenance. The machine documents must be carefully checked upon delivery to check for any imperfections. They must also be periodically checked taking into account the various expiry dates of the stamps and the driving license. The machine inside must appear neat. There must not be accumulated newspapers of any kind, leaflets or paper. Every evening it is necessary to remove any radio or cassette player, or anything else that could attract the attention of thieves. The machine must not be loaned to anyone except in truly urgent or exceptional cases. [...] It must become the habit of every companion to often look at the rear-view mirror of cars. In particular, whenever he goes home or goes to any structure of the organization, it is necessary to make sure that he is not followed. It is good to take the habit of making a few vicious turns specially designed to safely check that you are not being followed. 
1. Do not park them near the offices. 
2. In any case, the machine, even in action, must contain only the minimum indispensable mechanical tools useful for its and our effective functioning. 
3. Assume that the car can be searched or inspected at any time. 
4. The car is not always the best means of shelter. 
5. New cars must not be registered in the name of companions.
6. That the road tax and driving license are always in order and the car in perfect working order. 
7. Companions should always know the name of the owner of the borrowed car. 

HOUSES: 
Â«The house is an asset of the organization that is entrusted to the militant: it must be managed according to precise, mandatory rules, the same for everyone. Each house must be frequented exclusively by the militants who live there and known by another member of the previously designated organization or column. The latter will have to go to the house only for reasons of particular need. It is obvious, but unfortunately necessary, to reiterate that no one else (family members, legal and brigade companions) must know neither the house nor the area where it is located. The technique of bringing a companion to one's facility with a blindfolded eyes should be reviewed and used only in cases of absolute emergency. [...] The road must lend itself to easy control by the militant and open control by the power; that is, possibly it should not be close to bars, public places of various kinds: shops, institutes, warehouses. When a partner takes possession of a house of the organization, his first task is to build himself, in even the smallest details, as a well-defined social figure. He decides to present himself as a Fiat worker, or as a professor, or as a representative. [...] The role that each partner has assumed must then manifest itself consistently in his everyday life. [...] For example, if you have assumed the role of craftsman, you will have to leave the house before eight in the morning and not return until 12.30, be able to return at 14 and return and at 19 or later. This means that each comrade must organize his own work (appointments, inquiries) according to specific times [...] Except in exceptional cases, each militant must return home by midnight. If not strictly necessary, he eats his meals at home. [...] It must be said that the role assumed by each partner must be carefully studied in order to justify any irregularity in one's behavior. In principle, every militant must present himself with a reassuring and kind air to his neighbors, but strict confidentiality is absolutely necessary. 
1. Do not keep anything from the organization and the companions at home: the material must be delivered to Z (he is the person in charge of the connections of the single column) for centralization. 
2. Leave from the assumption that the house can be searched and inspected at any time. In the event of a search, ask first to notify your lawyer, who has the right to assist you. 
3. As in public places, do not assume provocative and disturbing attitudes. 
4. For those who move, choose buildings with an intercom, in order to avoid unnecessary concierge costs. 

PERSON: 
Each companion must be decently dressed and in order in person: beard done, hair cut. It is good to travel with no more than two documents, that is a driving license and an identity card not linked to anything. It is necessary to have with you only the material strictly necessary for the work you are conducting. Each soldier will have to carry his own weapon on him. [...] In case of arrest, the personal details of the document in possession are immediately declined. Only in front of the magistrate do they declare their personal details. Every militant must refuse to answer any kind of question. The claim of one's identity policy is a later fact that will possibly be agreed with the organization. [...] In the awards, if you are arrested, it is good to be able to exchange places with any carabiniere next to you, as recognition is often already pre-established. [...] At any time the enemy can locate a base, at each appointment the companion can be stalked, the blow can come at any time, all night and all day. In case of arrest, always deny. Experience shows that the enemy is hardly able to strike as we enter action, while more frequently he unleashes his attacks by slipping into the organization's snag. [...] In relations with family members, the political times of the work of the organization must be kept in mind. Before and after the actions, big or small, you can't have relationships. When the repression hits the legal zones, it is necessary to stay away in the most absolute way. Care must be taken to construct alibis resistant to lawyers, if a period of time is spent with them. [...] By clandestine work we mean the consolidation of a material economic, military and logistic base which guarantees full autonomy to our organization and constitutes a strategic background to work among the masses. [...] It is very important for the organization to be able not to be photographed or even filmed on TV. Often these events have caused the collapse of structures of the organization. 
1. Always carry an identity document with you which must be shown upon request. In case of refusal, you are accompanied to the police station for signs. 
2. Check the expiration of the passport and keep it updated. Who does not have it, do it immediately. 
3. Companions with a criminal record can check their position by requesting criminal certificates. 
4. The notebook of telephone numbers and names of companions must be abolished: the corresponding numbers can be found on the list telephone, those in common use are learned by heart; those that do not appear on the guide and that are not memorized, are personally coded and written on a piece of paper. 
5. Appointment agendas are allowed as long as the expired appointment sheets are destroyed; the use of weekly cards is recommended. 
6. Organisation addresses must be handed over to Z for centralization. 
7. Starting from the hypothesis that the habit does not make the monk. 

RELATIONSHIPS AND FRIENDSHIP: 
Relations with the law are the weakest point of all our work. The peripheral encirclement takes place in fact starting from those legal areas that are suspected to be in contact with the organization: wives, families, political avant-gardes who expose themselves. We must take it for granted that starting from these points the enemy will try to reach his clandestine comrades. It is therefore necessary to regulate these relationships in the most rigid way. 
1. To the outside world we need to acquire a dimension of "autonomy" by placing a barrier between oneself and others. 
2. Clean your own dangerous past. 

RELATIONS WITH COMPANIES EXTERNAL TO THE ORGANIZATION:
For no reason must the comrades of the regular forces frequent the homes of irregular comrades or militants who are not completely external to the organization. 
1. With these comrades the discussion concerns only general analyzes and strategy. Absolutely no reference should be made to the organization. 

SURVEILLANCE: 
1. Each companion must be able to detect, evaluate and verify (near the home, headquarters or when in the car) all anomalous situations (lights, columns, suspicious machines, etc.) and must indicate all the possible data to Z. Suspicions must be verified in order to avoid unnecessary alarmist tensions; this also applies to any news of stoppages etc. other comrades, house or office searches and the arrival of fascists. 
2. These notes are not enough to have them in your pocket or in your head: they must be assimilated and put it into practice from now on. Then they destroy themselves. 


ANY THOUGHTLESS ACTION IS THE BEGINNING OF TREASON. WITHOUT REALISING WE CAN BEHAVE AS SPIES OR SNITCHES. THE END RESULT IS THE SAME: IT WILL COST YOU DEARLY.
